같아. 우리 저기를 떠밀게 다 있을 것 같아. 현저는 음악이 늘어버리고 있어요. 여기서 외쭈가시는 점을 가만을 보고 있으면 좋을 것 같아. 현저가 좋은 것 같아. 요즘 빠질 스타일이 있는데 왜 태어를 만들어주는... 여기서? 어휴! 이 거스를 좀 펴줘야 될 것 같아. 어떤 헤어 마스카라인데? 임머리 없으니 되게 좋아요. 한가도. 근데 어느 정도 헤어나 메이크업을 했으니 옷을 골라야 되는데... 엄청 큰 캐리어 통편. 저희 발리 모든 짐이 여기에 가득한 분들. 이번에 새로 나온 센서 나이틴 타라옥스 나이인데... 우리 가장 큰 사이리 187에 들어가지고... 가지고 왔는데... 이게 발려온 거라구요. 한 날에 집을 싸웠어 내가 거의... 이 친구가 참 짧고 예쁘고 많이 들어갔어가지고... 그게 장점이 아퍼어. 캐리어는 안 돼요. 장점이 아퍼어. 캐리어를 펼치 공간도 부족할 때가 많다는 거에요. 그럴 때 이게 엄청 큰 단점이 되는 거 같아. 양반형도 되는 거? 기존 캐리어처럼 양쪽이 열려가지고... 근데 나는 이렇게 여기가 진짜 편한 거 같아. 그리고 또 여기 안에 기본적으로 내장되어 있는 타우치가 약간 새 종류로 되어있는데... 여기가 먼저 여기가? 먼저 너 손가락 말? 나는 헤어로운 풍면 하신 면이 위주로 다 보다는데... 이렇게 옷까지들을 넣어 놓고 여기를 한 번 채운 다음에 이렇게 놓고 신발 가방을 위에 올린다든지 그렇게 사용했는데 진짜 많이 들어보도록. 이 공간 활용하는 게 참 좋은 거 같아. 이렇게 해외같은 게 나오면... 진 랩어랠까봐요. 장근장치가 이렇게 두 분들로 되어있어서 안전하게 내 집으로 가다 싶다는 것도 좀 더 좋고 나 진짜 짐 많이 들고 싶어서 나는 이 학장에 진짜 쎄는 거 같아. 이것도 기본 자체가 엄청 많이 들어가는 데에도 확대해져. 바리바리도 안 되고 최고예요. 캐리어. 완전. 오정도까지 넣어 놓고. 갑자기 됩니다. 그리고 이렇게 여행을 하다 보면 캐리어가 망가지는 게 뭐 들리기 때문에 실제로 어디 있었던 거? 바퀴가 사라져 가고. 사라져서 샀어요. 얘는 좋은 게 센서 나이틀한 글로벌리 있어요. 그리고 언제 어디서 되는지 그 매력만 가면 수리가 과정하다는데 진짜 좋은 게 될 것 같아. 망가질이 있어? 발려주지 않을까? 있어? 있어. 또 수리가 가능하다고 하니 걱정 없이 최고다 지셔도 될 것 같아요. 그러면 이제 한 번 옷을 입어볼까? 네 이렇게. 너무 귀엽죠? 발리를 위해서 샀어요. 렌즈가 생겼어요. 원래 여행제에서 렌즈랑 안 깨낸 데 사진을 예쁘게 남겨고 싶어서 못 갔습니다. 이렇게 꼭 가보도록 할게요. 밥을 먹으러 가겠습니다. 오늘 또 맛있으면 굉장히 좋고. 약간 나시고래즈랑 먹고 싶어서 나시고래는 파란 데 가버렸고요. 여러분 이런 데서 소피을 해야 되네. 배운 거 좀 여기서 까먹어 볼까? 다 소피 한 번 배웠어. 네.
