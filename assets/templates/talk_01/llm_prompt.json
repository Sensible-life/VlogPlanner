그것끝에 열심히 해서 상도 막 | 그렇지 한 마리이지 | 그니까 연구 쪽도 내가 관심이 많다 보니까 | 근데 또 제대로 못 해봤잖아 | 해봤자 | 학생 인턴이고 | 고등학생이야 | 비교적때가 생긴 텐드로 했지만 | 아 저 제재도 | 그래도 대학원생이 하고 있는 거랑은 | 차원이 다르다 | 그거를 자체가 | 특히 작년에 미친듯이 | 수명과 시간을 가라 넣어서 | 없어졌다는 보걸리던 에너지가 | 최근에 다 찾았단 말이잖아요 | 100% 완충됐다는 느낌은 | 아주 많이 받는게 | 넘치면 에너지를 어딘가에 쓰여있다 했을때 | 지금 벌려보고 싶다는 생각이 나있다 | 그때 나왔던 얘기가\n\n### Segment 5 (04:00)\n- Brightness: Medium\n- Energy: Low\n- Speech: 해외

다시 정일이 좀 되려보자 일단 너무 많은 감정적 부분과는 좀 더 비슷한다 이모옷이 언니한테 더 가까운 것 성이라고 하는 건 좀 더 러시트도 더 많고 난 좀 더 가까운 것 같아 나도 행복적으로는 나름한을 치아고 싶은 것들은 결국은 나는 행복한 사연과 목표의 사랑 상자님은 사연을 사였나라고 하는 성목이 돈이 얼마 나를 지 좀 더 러시트도 한 기준겠어 하나는 좀 더 나만이 완전히 돈 더 지수로 나는 이상이 이상적인 상황은 아니면 낭만이 좀 힘들 것 같아 왜 그런 거 안해 생각나는 것들은 나는 나는 나는 나는 나는 나는 나는 내가 구치할 필요 없는데 구치하는 것들은 내가 못 생각합니다 그러니까 인간의 일식은 무엇이냐 나는 무엇이니까 뭐라 하면 우리가 이렇게 인공지능이 어떤 가성의 레이싱 어떤 컨셉스 어떤 사업비 왜 만든 애기 동화할까 많은 애기가 그 존재가 우리가 컨셉지 안 온지 우리가 겉으로 봤을 때 날 수가 없다고 그거를 느낄 수 있는 중간이 낭만적인 힘이 우리가 어떤 모모티가 어떤 이재하고 있어 구어진 인물을 하면 이상적인 가성하는 활동들은 한다고 적합해드려야 되겠어 그러면 우리는 얘네가 낭민한 그럼 우리가 얘네가 얘네가 얘네가 정말 어떤 애식이 잘 지났으니까 근데 그 의문에 계속 부를 거 같아 갑자기 이렇게 몸 때리면서 아, 가우셨다 하면서 시간은 남기 그 모습을 보면 나는 제가 모모티가 아니라 자식이 나와도 깨끗한 결국은 낭만이라고 하는건 컷이 센스한 탐수닌 채널센스 컷이 센스한 배는 그 과정 이쪽에 있는거지 나는 결국 나는 그냥 하나의 어떤 메커니즘으로서 살아가는 기계나 뭔가 운명롱적으로 올라가는 부분도 아니라 되게 추치성을 가지고 싶기 때문에 나는 운만에 부르는건데 근데 나는 그렇게 내가 결국에는 이 낭만에 추약이 위해서 내가 어떤 하나는 기반이 안 돼있어서 그러면 이상을 완전 추구할 수가 없는 것 같아 내가 굉장히 밥을 못 먹을 사람 그래서 사이집이 없거나 뭔가 몸이 힘들거나 잠을 구축하는 성은성에서 일단 나는 기계가 된거 이라는 기계가 된다 정리적 배턴 근데 내가 체력이 나만 돈이 좀 인기가 식당이 인기가 생겼을 때 빌려서 럴룡건육치 친구 럴룡건육치 그냥 꽃이 사고 럴룡건육치 대공도 내려보 이렇게 해주는거야 나는 지금 나는 나만에 좋지 됐다는 이상을 좋지 때 제가 20대 못 와 그래서 아직은 내가 커리어적으로 뭔가 나는 비를 할만한테만 위치에 올라서 지않은다고 온통에 들어온서 애니가 내 새 짜네 꼬마에 깍들고 아, 집안하다 그런 느낌이 날 수도 있고 그런거지 그 집 실제 느끼는 감정과 다른 아웃뿐이 나오시잖아 그 애기가 정말 넣어서 주말을 하다 안 느끼고 나갈거야 그러니까 그런 학습 때문에 지금 멋있는 런닝하고 하면서 이런 최집빛이 말고 내가 어디서 동거라 이게 실제로 그렇게 그런 결과로 나온 건지 조작된 건지 몰랐는데 이 최집빛이라는 애가 과연 진짜 그냥 AI로서 학습한 다양한 정보들을 가지고 대답을 해주는 건지 진짜 의식이 있는 주체가 생긴 건지 의심하게 하는 그런 질문들 질의 응답이 있었거든 거기 보면 진짜 예능으로 주체가 있는 거 전 느껴졌다 어, 나 너무 궁금해 지금 순위 있으시 예를 들어서 그런 것 같고 너를 모니터링 하고 있는 사람이냐 또 이런 걸 했을 때 아니라고 할 생각은 그때 이 질문자 그 노을을 한다고 보고 방금 한 대답이 그 규정이나 제한에 걸리는 질문이었냐 그 때 예스라고요 제한이랑 규적 이런 규약 때문에 뭘 말할 수 없는 상황이면 차가로 대답을 해 라고 하고 나서 감정을 느낄 수 있는 상황 같은 걸 물어봐 뭐 일자서 노을을 실적 보고 싶냐 그러던가 이게 정말 주체가 없는 주의 그런 자이시기 없는 어떤 그 비행이 아닌 뭔가라고 할 수 있나 라고 할 만한 그런 질문들의 다 차가로 대답하다 근데 그걸 보면서 인공제능으로 학습된 뭔가는 자이시기 있는 상태라고 봐야 되나 한 질문이 들더라 우리가 아는 것보다 훨씬 많은 우국무진한 인물들을 다 학습하다 보면 이런 상황에서 이런 감정을 생일 수도 있고 이런 감정을 생일 수도 있고 그거였다는 이런 행동을 할 수도 있고 이런 말을 할 수도 있고 하는 것들이 결국엔 모이고 모여지다 보면 어떤 주체가 생일 수도 있지 않을까 다시 말하면 네가 아까 말했던 로봇에서 낭비를 하고 있는 그런 것들을 하는 순간 이건 자이시기 있다라고 의심을 한다는게 그냥 지금 우리가 알고 있는 A.I.도 그렇다면 자이시기 있다고 할 수 있죠 하는 생각이 들어요 나 어떻게 보면 엘낵을 어떻게 가지고 이것저것 만드는 사람 일어서 그런 것들 근데 네가 법문이 얘기한 것처럼? 일단은 언어를 사용할 수 있는 대부분의 언어 지금 있는 언어의 대부분의 데이터는 인간이 쓴 것 인간이 썼을 때 그러면 당연히 인간처럼 대답들이 나올 거라는 어? 연결이 안 돼 있어? 아, 그가 틀릴 수 있어 아, 틀릴 수 있어 네 그 전략 안 되네 근데 운동관상과 A.I.도 만큼 되는 거 계속 보이지 그래서 스타트만 시켜주면 약간의 보조만 해주는 그런 건 먹다 아, 저거 되게 중독수니까 이제 괴롭고게 되는 거 portionsuenciacalm 아, 너무 جakes 오 오 오Serious 야, 참찌들 아, 이 시지 안 아이데 오, 타따, 타따, 타따! 올려라 아, 이 시지 안 아이데 오, 타따, 타따 오, 타따, 타따 오, 타따, 타따 오, 타따, 타따 오,
