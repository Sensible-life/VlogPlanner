Bright\n- Energy: Medium\n- Speech: 1요일 새벽 3시, 무슨 일인지 갑자기 눈이 떠졌어요. | 원래는 오늘 북한 산에 갈 계획이었는데 | 빨리 일어난 김에 조금 더 멀리 있는 곳에 나를 던져보고 싶은 충동이 들었어요. | 눈도 다 못든 채 변기에 앉아서 강원도에 있는 산들을 검색하기 시작했어요. | 그러다 평소에 가고 싶었던 민동산이 눈에 들어오는 거예요. | 거리가 멀어서 용기가 안 나가지 못했던 곳인데 | 오늘은 왠지 용기가 났어요. | 민동산 역차 편을 급히 알아보는데 | 3시간 뒤에 출발하는 처차가 있었어요. | 조금 서투로면 충분히 가능할 것 같아서 바로 떠나기로 했습니다. | 근데 대박인 게 제가 처차와 막차를 마일리지를 써서 예매를 했는데 | 그동안 쌓인 게 많았는지 단돈 2500원에 예매를 했어요. | 열타 자리도 마지막 남은 한 자리를 잡아 예약한 거라 | 완전 초으로 기비키였어요. | 지금은 새벽 4시 5시쯤이고요.\n\n### Segment 2 (01:00)\n- Brightness: Dark\n- Energy: Medium\n- Speech: 이제 첫 차를 타고 민동산에 가려고 합니다. | 조심히 잘 다녀올게요. | 아직 완전 밤이 헷갈려면 뭐 이런 거 같죠. | 근데 금방 뜰 것 같아요 여름이니까. | 버스를 타러 가기 전에 산에서 먹을 간식을 사러 왔어요. | 더운 여름에 하는 등산이니까 | 여행 중의 신경을 써야 한다고요. | 버스 타러 가고 있어요. | 저 청양리역으로 7시 30분까지 가야 되거든요. | 시간은 충분해서 천천히 여유롭게 즐기고 있습니다. | 버스 정류장과 골목은 정말 어두워서 무서웠지만 | 그 보여야면 내가 어디론가 떠나고 있다는 걸 실감하게 해주었어요. | 새벽에 버스를 타니까 조수화린을 받았어요. | 세상은 부지런한 사람에게 참 친절하고나 아 싶은 생각을 했어요. | 내 시간도 못 자고 시작한 하루여서 몸은 매우 피로했지만\n\n### Segment 3 (02:00)\n- Brightness: Bright\n- Energy: Medium\n- Speech: 내 자아가 좋아하는 일을 해서 그런지 폭발적인 에너지가 느껴졌어요. | 버스에서 내긴 이 금세 세상이 밝아줬더라고요. | 이제 대강력에서 청양리역으로 지하철 타고 운동합니다. | 멋있어. | 거기 스크벌이 나와요. | 치밀찍 일어나 움직이니까 허기가 지기 시작하더라고요. | 청양리역에 도착하면 꼭 밥을 먹어야겠다고 생각했어요. | 좋아하는 옷을 입고 등산하면 기분이 더 좋지 않나요? | 아이돌처럼 마른 몸은 아니지만 탄탄하고 건강한 내 몸을 사랑해주자 라고 생각했어요. | 산에서 먹을 담백질 반은 제가 제일 좋아하는 걸로 두 개 걸랐어요. | 그리고 조난당할까 봐 빵도 하나 샀습니다. | 10차 시간이 1시간이나 남아서 김밥집에 들어왔어요. | 제가 시킨 건 와사비참치 김밥입니다. | 진짜 존마팅. 김밥집에 젊어하고 등산을 준비하시는 분들이 많이 계셔서 혼자요도 외롭지 않았어요. | 김밥을 다 먹고 나서 10차를 차러갔어요.\n\n### Segment 4 (03:00)\n- Brightness: Bright\n- Energy: Medium\n- Speech: 제가 탈 10차는 청양리에서 동의까지 가는 10차였어요. | 내가 탈 10차가 맞는지 꼼꼼하게 확인하는 후에 탑승했습니다. | 이제는 완전히 해갔던 거서 커튼 넘어로 밝은 빛이 보였어요. | 어제까지만 해도 비가 그렇게 많이 오더니 저는 참 운이 좋은 사람인가 봐요. | 3시간 정도 10차에 타 있는 동안 거의 대부분 잠은서 시간을 보냈어요. | 그리고 잔도 배탈이 나서 이 바람이 많이 보는 화장실에서 해결을 했답니다. | 10시 40분쯤 민동산역에 들비여도 찾겠어. | 창바쿨을 미리 엽돈 강원도에 풍경이 너무 아름다워서 바로 카메라를 꺼내들고 10차에서 내렸어요. | 여기 너무 예뻐서 사람들이 전부 빠질 때까지 기다렸다가 소통한 필름에 한 코 담아갔습니다. | 산 입고까지 가는 길도 예쁠 것 같아서 사진집을 생각에 설레어요. | 이런 한적한 마을 분위기 너무 너무 헬리깁니다. | 옆에서 나온 이 작은 마을이 한 눈에 들어온 풍경이 보였어요. | 등산하기 전 배고파서 빵 하나 물 두개를 사서 챙겼고요.\n\n### Segment 5 (04:00)\n- Brightness: Bright\n- Energy: Medium\n- Speech: 산 입고까지 걸어가는 동안 길방을 좀 해줬어요. | 제가 늘 먹고 싶어 했었던 땅콩크림 샌들을 드디어 먹었어요. | 이것도 집에 바퀴소 먹었었다면 제 책감이 들었을 텐데 | 이렇게 활동적인 무드 속에서 먹으니 마음이 훨씬 가벼웠어요. | 같은 음식이라도 먹는 환경과 상황이 참 중요한 것 같아요. | 운동상 같은 경우 이제 뭐지? | 뭐 정도 걸어가야 되는데. | 걸어가는 길은 매우 더웠지만 예쁜 풍경 덕분에 힘들지 않았어요. | 사실 빵 먹는 게 너무 좋아서 아닌 들었던 것 같기도 해요. | 이런 훌륭은 일 realizing | 요즘 엔지 브이로그에서 많이 보이는 각도를 따라해 봤습니다.\n\n### Segment 6 (05:00)\n- Brightness: Bright\n- Energy: Medium\n- Speech: 제 모자는 압박구고 생산 가방은 오마구 가져왔습니다. | 새벽에 나갔다 새벽에 들어갈 거라 길길 일은 없을 것 같아요. | 여기가 차돈들 차돈도 없어서 그냥 꺼다내 줘도 돼요. | 스메자. | 제가 오늘 올해 3코스는 중 3초코스인가? | 그거인데요. | 이게 민종산이 가장 표적인 코스이고 올라가는데는 1시간 30분? | 내려올 때 또 1시간 30분. | 총 3시간 걸린다고 하고 많이 돈 그렇게 어렵지 않대요. | 아 근데 진짜 너무 햇빛 뜨거워요. | 벌써 진짜 너무도.\n\n### Segment 7 (06:00)\n- Brightness: Bright\n- Energy: Medium\n- Speech: 그래도 비가 안 왔어. 너무 좋다. | 민종산이 한국에 있는 스위스라고 하더라고요. | 정도로 진짜 푸르르구 넓은 생산이 좀 특징인 경산이라고 하더라고요. | 너무 기대 좀 합니다. | 사범으로 쌓여있는 산과 구름을 구경하고 | 알근 우리 허렌은 천을 구경하며 갔다 보면 | 산 후에 거의 다 붙었으면 있다. | 나 지금? | 네. | 저 차 타고 왔어요. | 사실 밥은 손에 가시죠. | 네 오늘 아침에 와서 저녁에 마지막 집 하고 가요. | 김선 방하고. | 네, 의사랑 이런 거 먹고 가시네. | 여기 그냥 제충 맛있어. | 아이고 가서 왔고 카페 핫가를 같이 갈 거 같아요. | 사실 혼자 와서 많이 적적했는데 | 등산 메이트가 생겨서 너무 좋았어요. | 날씨가 너무 습하고 더워서 20분만에 온 몸이 다 좋아졌어요.\n\n### Segment 8 (07:00)\n- Brightness: Bright\n- Energy: Low\n- Speech: 아이고 더워. | 안녕하세요. | 감사합니다. | 감사합니다. | 감사합니다. | 감사합니다. | 사안카메라 음식이니까 | 제가 집 구성에서 꼭 가와야 하는 맛집이네요. | 맛집이요? | 네. | 아... | 구성하며 일단 국밥을 낸다. | 아 국밥을 낸다? | 거기에 추천해주실 수 있어요? | 아픈데 국밥 진짜. | 사람마다 가게. | 아... | 아... | 오... | 아... | 아 수이스 아니냐고요. | 근데 이거 정상도 안 돼요.\n\n### Segment 9 (08:00)\n- Brightness: Bright\n- Energy: Low\n- Speech: 아 이제부터 그 나무 없는 시작인가봐. | 어떤 날씨까지 완벽할까. | 아 여기 그 별명이 텔리톱이 동산이라고 하던데요? | 아 그래요? | 네. | 근데 진짜 뭐야? | 그니까... | 여기가 민동산 시작이라고 봐도 되겠다. | 앞에 저 길이 보이네. | 민교라고 예쁜 언니가 찍어주신 소중한 영상. | 이렇게 뛰어난 여도 풍경이 너무 예뻐서 | 진짜 하나도 안 힘들었어요. | 아 용쭤면 5km 진짜 금방 가겠어요. | 다 왔다 다 왔다.\n\n### Segment 10 (09:00)\n- Brightness: Bright\n- Energy: High\n- Speech: 아... | 이 때부터 힘든 거고 보고 | 사방이 다 아름다워서 막 돌아다니게 돼요. | 그리고 장난시즈니라 사람도 많이 없었어요. | 여름 등상에 안하냐. | 그래 근데. | 사방이 윈도우 바탕 하면 같은 광할지 | 들리는 소리는 바람소리와 풀버레소리? | 사방에서 풍경은 향긋한 풀램색까지 | 날씨만 괜찮았다면 | 이곳에서 명상이나 요가를 하고 싶었어요.\n\n### Segment 11 (10:00)\n- Brightness: Bright\n- Energy: Medium\n- Speech: 구독해 주시나요? | 감사합니다. | 이렇게 인연 사인게 너무 좋아요. | 여행이 아닌데. | 여행도 못났다 봐. | 아 맞아요. | 혼자 여행하시면 사람들 막 만나고 싶고 그렇잖아요. | 아 소름돋고 외도 왔어요. | 서울 사람들에 파가워요. | 많이 향터만 있었어요. | 돌리네라는 작은 호수 가까이에도 가볼겁니다. | 멀리서 봤을때 진짜 작아 보였는데 | 가까이 가니까 꽤 컸어요. | 아 완도 건드리가 매워하지 않나요? | 응. | 그래도 같이 밥 먹을 사람이 있어서 너무 다행이에요.\n\n### Segment 12 (11:00)\n- Brightness: Bright\n- Energy: Medium\n- Speech: 짠. | 홍밥도 좋지만 항상 홍밥을 했다고요. | 등산 운전하면 | 저에게 등산은 진정한 나를 찾는 수단인 것 같아요. | 제가 진짜로 좋아하는 일에 정신없이 물도 하고 있으면 | 그 순간이 제 자신과 친해지고 가까워지는 기분이 들거든요. | 그때 제 자신에게 말을 걸어주는 거죠. | 너는 이런걸 좋아하는구나 하고. | 감사합니다. | 아 완도 바보자마. | 아 네? | 아 여기는 그런 것들을 시켰다. | 혹시 언니 바람 너무 좋아. | 바람이 18도에요. | 멋지적지 다 내려왔네요.\n\n### Segment 13 (12:00)\n- Brightness: Bright\n- Energy: Medium\n- Speech: 오 이 정도 있네. | 인정을 한번 받아 봐야겠다. | 너무 더워서 산 바로 아래에 있는 공대로 집에 들어왔어요. | 시간이 언제 이렇게 흘렀는지 벌써 되시었어요. | 저는 운동하면 식욕이 도는 편이라서 막 구하고 잘 먹었는데 | 언니는 너무 휘 밀들었는지 거의 먹지 못했어요. | 오늘 처음 만난 사이지만 언니가 너무 걱정되고 | 슬프고 속상하고 밥을 더 먹이고 싶고 점점점점. | 저는 다이어트하면서 제 왕성한 식욕이 항상 립기만 했는데 | 확상 먹고 싶어도 먹지 못하면서 괴로워하는 | 그런 모습을 들어서 | 언제나 왕성한 제 시켜보기 처음으로 공정적으로 보였어요. | 언니와 헤어지고 혼자 만의 시간을 보내려고 찾아온 시작드카페입니다. | 이곳에서 저는 기타 시간 전까지 쉬었다 갈 생각이에요. | 소품적처럼 물건들이 전시되어 있어서 구경하는 재미도 있었습니다. | 뭔가 강원도 아니랄까 막 감자키림도 있더라고요.\n\n### Segment 14 (13:00)\n- Brightness: Bright\n- Energy: Medium\n- Speech: 조문지와 메뉴판을 받아서

3시, 무슨 일인지 갑자기 눈이 떠졌어요. 원래는 오늘 북한 산에 갈 계획이었는데 빨리 일어난 김에 조금 더 멀리 있는 곳에 나를 던져보고 싶은 충동이 들었어요. 눈도 다 못든 채 변기에 앉아서 강원도에 있는 산들을 검색하기 시작했어요. 그러다 평소에 가고 싶었던 민동산이 눈에 들어오는 거예요. 거리가 멀어서 용기가 안 나가지 못했던 곳인데 오늘은 왠지 용기가 났어요. 민동산 역차 편을 급히 알아보는데 3시간 뒤에 출발하는 처차가 있었어요. 조금 서투로면 충분히 가능할 것 같아서 바로 떠나기로 했습니다. 근데 대박인 게 제가 처차와 막차를 마일리지를 써서 예매를 했는데 그동안 쌓인 게 많았는지 단돈 2500원에 예매를 했어요. 열타 자리도 마지막 남은 한 자리를 잡아 예약한 거라 완전 초으로 기비키였어요. 지금은 새벽 4시 5시쯤이고요. 이제 첫 차를 타고 민동산에 가려고 합니다. 조심히 잘 다녀올게요. 아직 완전 밤이 헷갈려면 뭐 이런 거 같죠. 근데 금방 뜰 것 같아요 여름이니까. 버스를 타러 가기 전에 산에서 먹을 간식을 사러 왔어요. 더운 여름에 하는 등산이니까 여행 중의 신경을 써야 한다고요. 버스 타러 가고 있어요. 저 청양리역으로 7시 30분까지 가야 되거든요. 시간은 충분해서 천천히 여유롭게 즐기고 있습니다. 버스 정류장과 골목은 정말 어두워서 무서웠지만 그 보여야면 내가 어디론가 떠나고 있다는 걸 실감하게 해주었어요. 새벽에 버스를 타니까 조수화린을 받았어요. 세상은 부지런한 사람에게 참 친절하고나 아 싶은 생각을 했어요. 내 시간도 못 자고 시작한 하루여서 몸은 매우 피로했지만 내 자아가 좋아하는 일을 해서 그런지 폭발적인 에너지가 느껴졌어요. 버스에서 내긴 이 금세 세상이 밝아줬더라고요. 이제 대강력에서 청양리역으로 지하철 타고 운동합니다. 멋있어. 거기 스크벌이 나와요. 치밀찍 일어나 움직이니까 허기가 지기 시작하더라고요. 청양리역에 도착하면 꼭 밥을 먹어야겠다고 생각했어요. 좋아하는 옷을 입고 등산하면 기분이 더 좋지 않나요? 아이돌처럼 마른 몸은 아니지만 탄탄하고 건강한 내 몸을 사랑해주자 라고 생각했어요. 산에서 먹을 담백질 반은 제가 제일 좋아하는 걸로 두 개 걸랐어요. 그리고 조난당할까 봐 빵도 하나 샀습니다. 10차 시간이 1시간이나 남아서 김밥집에 들어왔어요. 제가 시킨 건 와사비참치 김밥입니다. 진짜 존마팅. 김밥집에 젊어하고 등산을 준비하시는 분들이 많이 계셔서 혼자요도 외롭지 않았어요. 김밥을 다 먹고 나서 10차를 차러갔어요. 제가 탈 10차는 청양리에서 동의까지 가는 10차였어요. 내가 탈 10차가 맞는지 꼼꼼하게 확인하는 후에 탑승했습니다. 이제는 완전히 해갔던 거서 커튼 넘어로 밝은 빛이 보였어요. 어제까지만 해도 비가 그렇게 많이 오더니 저는 참 운이 좋은 사람인가 봐요. 3시간 정도 10차에 타 있는 동안 거의 대부분 잠은서 시간을 보냈어요. 그리고 잔도 배탈이 나서 이 바람이 많이 보는 화장실에서 해결을 했답니다. 10시 40분쯤 민동산역에 들비여도 찾겠어. 창바쿨을 미리 엽돈 강원도에 풍경이 너무 아름다워서 바로 카메라를 꺼내들고 10차에서 내렸어요. 여기 너무 예뻐서 사람들이 전부 빠질 때까지 기다렸다가 소통한 필름에 한 코 담아갔습니다. 산 입고까지 가는 길도 예쁠 것 같아서 사진집을 생각에 설레어요. 이런 한적한 마을 분위기 너무 너무 헬리깁니다. 옆에서 나온 이 작은 마을이 한 눈에 들어온 풍경이 보였어요. 등산하기 전 배고파서 빵 하나 물 두개를 사서 챙겼고요. 산 입고까지 걸어가는 동안 길방을 좀 해줬어요. 제가 늘 먹고 싶어 했었던 땅콩크림 샌들을 드디어 먹었어요. 이것도 집에 바퀴소 먹었었다면 제 책감이 들었을 텐데 이렇게 활동적인 무드 속에서 먹으니 마음이 훨씬 가벼웠어요. 같은 음식이라도 먹는 환경과 상황이 참 중요한 것 같아요. 운동상 같은 경우 이제 뭐지? 뭐 정도 걸어가야 되는데. 걸어가는 길은 매우 더웠지만 예쁜 풍경 덕분에 힘들지 않았어요. 사실 빵 먹는 게 너무 좋아서 아닌 들었던 것 같기도 해요. 이런 훌륭은 일 realizing 요즘 엔지 브이로그에서 많이 보이는 각도를 따라해 봤습니다. 제 모자는 압박구고 생산 가방은 오마구 가져왔습니다. 새벽에 나갔다 새벽에 들어갈 거라 길길 일은 없을 것 같아요. 여기가 차돈들 차돈도 없어서 그냥 꺼다내 줘도 돼요. 스메자. 제가 오늘 올해 3코스는 중 3초코스인가? 그거인데요. 이게 민종산이 가장 표적인 코스이고

있어요? 아픈데 국밥 진짜. 사람마다 가게. 아... 아... 오... 아... 아 수이스 아니냐고요. 근데 이거 정상도 안 돼요. 아 이제부터 그 나무 없는 시작인가봐. 어떤 날씨까지 완벽할까. 아 여기 그 별명이 텔리톱이 동산이라고 하던데요? 아 그래요? 네. 근데 진짜 뭐야? 그니까... 여기가 민동산 시작이라고 봐도 되겠다. 앞에 저 길이 보이네. 민교라고 예쁜 언니가 찍어주신 소중한 영상. 이렇게 뛰어난 여도 풍경이 너무 예뻐서 진짜 하나도 안 힘들었어요. 아 용쭤면 5km 진짜 금방 가겠어요. 다 왔다 다 왔다. 아... 이 때부터 힘든 거고 보고 사방이 다 아름다워서 막 돌아다니게 돼요. 그리고 장난시즈니라 사람도 많이 없었어요. 여름 등상에 안하냐. 그래 근데. 사방이 윈도우 바탕 하면 같은 광할지 들리는 소리는 바람소리와 풀버레소리? 사방에서 풍경은 향긋한 풀램색까지 날씨만 괜찮았다면 이곳에서 명상이나 요가를 하고 싶었어요. 구독해 주시나요? 감사합니다. 이렇게 인연 사인게 너무 좋아요. 여행이 아닌데. 여행도 못났다 봐. 아 맞아요. 혼자 여행하시면 사람들 막 만나고 싶고 그렇잖아요. 아 소름돋고 외도 왔어요. 서울 사람들에 파가워요. 많이 향터만 있었어요. 돌리네라는 작은 호수 가까이에도 가볼겁니다. 멀리서 봤을때 진짜 작아 보였는데 가까이 가니까 꽤 컸어요. 아 완도 건드리가 매워하지 않나요? 응. 그래도 같이 밥 먹을 사람이 있어서 너무 다행이에요. 짠. 홍밥도 좋지만 항상 홍밥을 했다고요. 등산 운전하면 저에게 등산은 진정한 나를 찾는 수단인 것 같아요. 제가 진짜로 좋아하는 일에 정신없이 물도 하고 있으면 그 순간이 제 자신과 친해지고 가까워지는 기분이 들거든요. 그때 제 자신에게 말을 걸어주는 거죠. 너는 이런걸 좋아하는구나 하고. 감사합니다. 아 완도 바보자마. 아 네? 아 여기는 그런 것들을 시켰다. 혹시 언니 바람 너무 좋아. 바람이 18도에요. 멋지적지 다 내려왔네요. 오 이 정도 있네. 인정을 한번 받아 봐야겠다. 너무 더워서 산 바로 아래에 있는 공대로 집에 들어왔어요. 시간이 언제 이렇게 흘렀는지 벌써 되시었어요. 저는 운동하면 식욕이 도는 편이라서 막 구하고 잘 먹었는데 언니는 너무 휘 밀들었는지 거의 먹지 못했어요. 오늘 처음 만난 사이지만 언니가 너무 걱정되고 슬프고 속상하고 밥을 더 먹이고 싶고 점점점점. 저는 다이어트하면서 제 왕성한 식욕이 항상 립기만 했는데 확상 먹고 싶어도 먹지 못하면서 괴로워하는 그런 모습을 들어서 언제나 왕성한 제 시켜보기 처음으로 공정적으로 보였어요. 언니와 헤어지고 혼자 만의 시간을 보내려고 찾아온 시작드카페입니다. 이곳에서 저는 기타 시간 전까지 쉬었다 갈 생각이에요. 소품적처럼 물건들이 전시되어 있어서 구경하는 재미도 있었습니다. 뭔가 강원도 아니랄까 막 감자키림도 있더라고요. 조문지와 메뉴판을 받아서 이치구니가 너무 좋더라고요. 방금 밥을 먹고 왔지만 아직 빵은 한톤도 먹지 않았습니다. 저의 빵 고르는 지주는 얼마나 폭폭한가입니다. 베이글, 식빵, 치아바타처럼 담백하고 폭폭한 빵을 사랑해요. 주문하러 내려와서 민동산이 역소 살 수 있냐고 물어보고 있어요. 민동산 역소가 뭐냐면요. 이거예요. 이거예요. 이거예요. 이거예요. 이거예요. 이거예요. 이거예요. 이거예요. 이거예요. 이거예요. 이거예요. 민동산 사진으로 만든 역소. 이따 올라가서 잘 세이브 해드릴게요. 크림 치즈, 레몬 크림 치즈, 올리브 마요네즈를 돌려줬어요. 크림은 드라이 있었는데 물을 더 필요하시면 좋겠어요. 기본 빵의 스프레트 발라먹는 거 진심으로 사랑하는데 오늘 널 끝장내지 않고 서울에 돌아가지 않겠어. 양심상 음료는 홍차입니다. 오phod 빵먹다 말고 옆서 포스약 떼고 있어요. 오늘 다녀온 민동산의 총원을 알기억 할 수 있는 좋은 기념품인 것 같아요. 민동산은 가을발 떼바 풍경도 유명한데 그 모습이 담긴 약서도 있네요. 오늘 정말 많이 보고은 크릉함을 하얀 고등, triplerine에 담긴 약서도 있구요. 이 국적인 스위스 풍경이 높은 역소도 있었고 이 역소들은 방에 붙여놓고 힘들 때마다 이 순간을 추억하려구요 등산 끝내고 읽히 쓰고 싶어서 집에서부터 챙겨온 애기장이에요 오늘 새벽에 깨서 느꼈던 강렬한 감정들에 놀라운 내가 모르고 있던 내 새로운 모습들 새로운 사람들과의 관계에서 느꼈던 나의 감정들을 천천히 써내려가 천천히 써내려 봤어요 일기를 쓰는 것도 내 자신과 대화하는 좋은 방법 중에 하나인 것 같아요 일기를 다 쓰고 책을 읽으면 시간을 보내고 있어요 지금 읽고 있는 책은 살을 빼자고 행복을 뺄 순 없잖아 입니다 지금 이제 상황에 공감되는 내용들이 많아 중간중간 울고 계요 화이트한 스파이프에 4시간은 밖에 못 잡고 등산도 4시간을 해가지고 지금 매우 피곤한 상태에요 근데 저는 운동하면 도파 및이도라서 오히려 잠이게는 스타일이라 잠은 잘 안 오더라고요 책을 다가 기억하고 싶은 내용은 일기장에 옮겨져 적었어요 이제 생각도 하고 책도 읽으니까 3시간은 정말 빠르게 지나갔어요 저는 이제 연차시간 거의 다해서 집에 가봐야 될 것 같아요 너무 무거운 것이셨지만 그래도 어릴리니까 이 하루가야겠죠 회사하고 맨날 등산하고 방목구 참아시면서 살고 싶다 회사하고 할 수장에서 12시간 쇠지르면서 더블톱핑뽀케 새끼 먹고 싶다 회사하고 머리 끝끝든 다음에 저래 들어 가서 스님들 식사하신 글을 신화 설거지에 드리고 싶다 집가는 무궁아우를 기다리고 있는 중이고요 신발에 묻은 것은 은가가 아닙니다 요행을 끝나고 돌아가는 요차는 정말 낙만이 없게 느껴져요 친구분이랑 같이 안고 싶어하시는 분이 계셔서 제 자리를 바꿔드렸더니 고맙다면서 이거 지구가신 귀여운 사람, 사랑합니다 몸이 참금망근에서 돌아가는 기차 안에서 내내 참 만졌어요 여기시 41분의 청양기역에 도착을 했고요 청양기역에서 우리 집 가진 90분 정도 걸려요 내가 참 먼 길에 다섯분 아시퍼요 트측 타고 나와서 막 차 타고 돌아가는 지국에 스케줄이었죠 안방범버게 꼬집꼬집에 좋고 체력은 없고 수년 부족인 상태지만 오히려 정신은 말고 건강해진 하루입니다 남들은 굳이 왜 그렇게 힘들게 사냐고 하지만 아 이 엄청난 듣도를 말로 설명을 자신이 배번 없어서 언제나 아 그러게 하고 다을 하고 있어요 여기 2시 30분에 도착을 해서 집 꼭 잘 준비를 하고 있습니다 언제나 이별은 가끔씩",
