Speech: 안녕하세요 여러분. 저는 이제 아침에 요가를 가려고 준비를 하고 있습니다. | 준비를 한 번 넣고 선크림 바르고 약간 립밤 바르고 끝인데 | 요가를 지금 한 달 멤버 집을 다 하고 이제 리뉴얼 됐어요. | 근데 제가 너무 스스로에게 뿌듯한 게 한 달에 20일을 갖더라고요. | 그래서 제가 주 오일을 다 챙겨서 갔고 제가 이게 사실 요가원에 지금 처음 끊는 게 아니고 | 한국에서부터 계속 뭔가 끊었다가 끊었다가 끊었다가 이렇게 했었거든요.\n\n### Segment 5 (04:00)\n- Brightness: Medium\n- Energy: Low\n- Speech: 약간 재미를 못 붙였다 할까? | 근데 이번에 마음을 좀 진지하게 먹었던 게 요즘 보면 사람들이 좀 너무 정서적으로 굉장히 뭐랄까 | 산만하잖아요. 저만 그런가요. | 콘텐츠도 너무 많고 릴�스 이런 것도 너무 많고 그래서 그런지 제가 뭔가 하나의 집중을 잘 못 하더라고요. | 운동 헬스 같은 걸 때도 막 너무 다른 생각을 많이 하고 막 파켓스 같은 거 뭐지? | 막 이렇게 해서 계속 그런 거 보고 좀 사람이 너무 정신이 없길래 | 뭔가 이 뭔가 마음을 좀 진정시키는 그런 운동이 필요하다. | 결국 다시 요가를 선택을 하게 됐습니다. | 지금 제가 꽂은이 나가 보니까 아침에 이 요가로 여는 하루가 굉장히 차분하고 좋은 것 같아요. | 우선 요가를 했다는 거 자체가 성취검도 있고 그다음에 요가를 하면서 명상을 하는 것도 굉장히 좋고\n\n### Segment 6 (05:00)\n- Brightness: Medium\n- Energy: Low\n- Speech: 어쨌든 몸을 약간 부드럽게 깨우기 때문에 헬스를 전 아침에 하면 조금 피곤한 편이거든요. | 근데 이 요가를 하면 그래도 조금 차분하게 뭔가 가볍게. | 뭔가 근육이 뭔가 맑게 깨인 느낌? 그런 느낌으로 하루를 시작할 수 있어서 굉장히 좋더라고요. | 헬멧 챙겨서 갈 거예요. | 오자를 쓰고 오늘은 수업이 9시 반여가지고 시간이 너무 많이 남아가지고 조금 뭘 먹고 갈게요. | 근데 제가 작념에 걸렸어가지고 먹을 수 있는 게 많이 없어요. | 아침에는 그냥 계란, 토요일 이렇게 먹고 가겠습니다.\n\n### Segment 7 (06:00)\n- Brightness: Medium\n- Energy: Low\n- Speech: 3 zu 13 lord | 지금 7일내분에

Medium\n- Energy: Low\n- Speech: 약간 구수한 향이 나고 이제 카페인이 없어서 | 그냥 카페인이 조금 힘드신 분들은 요즘 호지차도 많이 찾으시는 것 같더라고요.\n\n### Segment 9 (08:00)\n- Brightness: Medium\n- Energy: Low\n\n### Segment 10 (09:00)\n-

뜨면 쓸까라고 생각을 해봤는데 그런 이야기를 잠깐 하면서 저는 얼른 준비를 해보도록 하겠습니다. | 이제 브이로그를 하면 굉장히 뭐랄까 세팅을 많이 하려고 하는 것 같더라고요. | 막 화장도 막 되어 있어야 될 것 같고 조금 가식적이라고 해야 될까요. | 옷도 막 좀 생겨 입어야 될 것 같고 그런 부담감이 있었어요. | 그래서 그런지 좀 카메라를 잘 안 키게 되더라고요. | 저도 모르게 그래서 좀 뜨몇다 그러면서 나도 되게 브이로그라는 사람인데 | 좀 뭐랄까 솔직하지 못한 그런 브이로그을 했었나? | 라고 생각을 하고 있단 와중에 제가 유튜브를 하니까 사람들을 많이 만나거든요. | 일적이든 사적이든 만나는데 그러면 유튜브를 통해서 만난 분들이 한 80% 정도가 첫 만남에\n\n### Segment 13 (12:00)\n- Brightness: Medium\n- Energy: Low\n- Speech: 어 유튜브랑 성격이 굉장히 다르시네요 라고 말하시더라고요. | 근데 그게 대화를 30분 하고 이런 것도 아니야. | 그냥 통성명 정도 했을 때 그 이미지가 엄청 다르대요. | 그 이유가 이제 유튜브에서는 제가 되게 좀 조용하고 | 좀 뭐랄까 저군조건 하려고 하고 약간 제 추구미가 그런 건가 봐요. | 그런데 실제로 보면 저는 사실 말도 되게 많고 좀 털토란 편이거든요. | 어떻게 보면 그래서 그런지 그냥 그 인사하는 순간에 바로 성격이 굉장히 다르시다 이렇게 말씀을 많이 하시더라고요. | 그리고 최근에 그 일을 또 겪으면서 아 내가 조금 자연스럽지 못한 방향으로 | 어 유튜브라고 있었구나 이게 다 나도 이러는데 S.S.라는 다 화상인가? | 이런 생각을 좀 했었고요. | 그리고 이제 가끔 지인분들도 가끔 연락 보시고 하는데 | 오면 어 뭐 되게 자유로우 보여 뭐 되게 좋아 보여 라고 말씀을 하시는데\n\n### Segment 14 (13:00)\n- Brightness: Medium\n- Energy: Low\n- Speech: 사실은 뭐 그것도 한 제가 좋아 보이려고 편집을 한 영상이잖아요. | 그러니까 그런 것들을 보시고 말씀을 하시는 분들도 계시는 것 같고 | 물론 그냥 저 기분 좋으라고 그냥 안 붙아 하시는 분들도 계시지만 | 어쨌든 브이로그 라는 게 제가 이렇게 2년간 3년간 해보면서 느끼는 점은 | 아무리 내가 솔직하려고 해도 사실 내 일상과 내 생각에 100분의 일도 | 뭔가 다 보여주지를 못한다. | 그리고 어쩔 수 없이 이 사람이라는 게 정제를 해서 할 수밖에 없구나. | 라는 생각이 좀 들었어요. | 제가 조금 더 그랬던 것 같고 그래서 앞으로는 진짜 좀 | 자유로운 방향으로 해보는 게 어떨까라는 생각도 했습니다. | 그래서 여러분들도 S.S.라는 저도 많이 리스룩 보지만 | 진짜 요가나 명상이나 이런 것이면서 조금 더 자기에게 집중을 하고\n\n### Segment 15 (14:00)\n- Brightness: Medium\n- Energy: Low\n- Speech: 여러분들도 S.S.너 많이 하지 마시고 그냥 제거 보세요. | 제거. | 덤번하기 그지 없는 아주 참 이게 어쩔 수 없나봐요. | 그쵸 사람이라는 게. | 얘가 보여주고 싶은 것만 보여주기 때문에. | 그래서 아무튼 오늘

있어야 될 것 같고 조금 가식적이라고 해야 될까요. 옷도 막 좀 생겨 입어야 될 것 같고 그런 부담감이 있었어요. 그래서 그런지 좀 카메라를 잘 안 키게 되더라고요. 저도 모르게 그래서 좀 뜨몇다 그러면서 나도 되게 브이로그라는 사람인데 좀 뭐랄까 솔직하지 못한 그런 브이로그을 했었나? 라고 생각을 하고 있단 와중에 제가 유튜브를 하니까 사람들을 많이
