[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.100]
날씨가 좋구만

[00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.100]
안녕하세요 저는 지금 브리즈번이고요

[00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:09.500]
오늘 진짜 브리즈번을 떠나는 날입니다

[00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.100]
마음이 심성생성하네

[00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.600]
신나면서도 아쉽고 약간 그런 느낌이에요 지금

[00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.600]
아무튼 일단 집을 다 싹거든요

[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.600]
여기 이제 충전기 넣어야 돼서

[00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.400]
여기 이렇게 있고 캠핑용 진들

[00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.000]
이거 이거

[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.200]
짐이 너무 많이 씁니다 지금

[00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.700]
저희가 캠핑 여행을 하기로 하긴 했는데

[00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.400]
캠핑카 이런 걸 빌링건 전혀 아니고

[00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.500]
그냥 친구가 타던 차를 가지고 가는 거거든요

[00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.900]
그래서 저는 진짜 지금 걱정이 너무 돼요

[00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.400]
이 짐을 다 싫을 수 있을 것인가

[00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.900]
왜냐면 제진만 있는 게 아니라

[00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.800]
제 친구 커플짐도 있잖아요

[00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.700]
그게 어떻게 다 들어가지 내 머리온이에게 안 되는데

[00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.200]
친구들은 걱정하지 말라고 하니까

[00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.200]
Like there

[00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.200]
at the corner

[00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.700]
Oh my gosh

[00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.600]
Oh my god

[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.100]
How can we do it?

[00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.500]
I need to bring this

[00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.000]
Slag in

[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.500]
Let's go drop off the chair

[00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.000]
저 친구들에 대한 소개 잠깐 하자면

[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.500]
에릭 이랑 로나라는 친구고요

[00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.000]
호스탄에서 만나고 둘은 커플이에요

[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.700]
그리고 저 둘은 저 서호주를 로드 트립한 경험이 있습니다

[00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.700]
그래서 아주 마음이 놓인다

[00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.300]
저 짐만 싫을 수 있다면

[00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.800]
청드렸던 내 방 안녕

[00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.000]
넌 정말 좋은 방이었어

[00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.800]
I don't think that's moving

[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.600]
Alright so that's the first one

[00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.600]
고마워

[00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:02.600]
You know

[00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.300]
결국은 해냈다

[00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:05.600]
Yeah

[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:06.600]
Exactly

[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:07.600]
I'm okay

[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.600]
I'm good

[00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.900]
야 이게 다 들었다는 게 신기하다 나는

[00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.200]
가옥시다

[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.200]
top three moment

[00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.200]
You sing in on the ggm song

[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.200]
Yeah okay

[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.200]
I know

[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.200]
honestly one of top three was singing

[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.600]
고마워

[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:31.700]
오

[00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:32.700]
In Korean

[00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.700]
오 No it was a member in the end Korean

[00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.200]
I don't know I just like the normal days

[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.700]
I really like the working in my class

[00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:41.700]
와 진짜

[00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.200]
I really like my piano

[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.200]
Yeah

[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.200]
And for us it's a little bit tired

[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.200]
but after I used to it it was fun

[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.700]
I like to work with the people there

[00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.700]
Really all the young people there?

[00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.700]
Yeah they're around like 21 22

[00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.200]
but they are really crazy

[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.200]
Young crazy girl and boys

[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.700]
오늘의 목적지는 바이러움 베이라는 곳입니다

[00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.200]
여기는 드리즈번에서 그냥 당해지 여행으로도 많이 가는 곳이라서

[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.200]
2시간?

[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.100]
2시간 던데서

[00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:13.200]
저갈 것 같아

[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.200]
1시간 반

[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.200]
그리고 오늘 거의 케이핑을 하고

[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.700]
이제 내일 또 내일의 여행을 할 겁니다

[00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:20.700]
왜 바르르르르르

[00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:22.700]
뭐지?

[00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:23.700]
재밌겠다

[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.200]
오 뭐야

[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.700]
아 파트랑은 원래?

[00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:30.700]
고마워

[00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:31.700]
고마워

[00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.700]
But do you prefer chocolate?

[00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:36.700]
No

[00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:37.700]
Usually it gets money

[00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.700]
It's the first time because I've ever ordered chocolate

[00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.200]
But the chocolate denied him

[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.200]
I know exactly

[00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.200]
Eric likes to

[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.200]
even though like he knows what he's favorite thing is

[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:46.700]
he's too likes to try

[00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.200]
like things that he doesn't really like that much

[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.200]
Yeah me too

[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.700]
I always try new things

[00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.200]
No no no new things

[00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.700]
things that you don't like that much

[00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:55.700]
Keep life interesting

[00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:10.700]
So is it here?

[00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.200]
Nice

[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.200]
Top on the campus site

[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.200]
Pan

[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.700]
Do you want to go to the beach first?

[00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:18.200]
I think so

[00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:19.200]
I think it's the same

[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:20.200]
Okay

[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:21.200]
This is cute

[00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.200]
This campsite is so cute

[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.200]
I think this one is probably the most

[00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.200]
camping campsite that we would have

[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.200]
Campy campsite

[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.200]
This is the best one we so freaking

[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.200]
Okay the fancy one

[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.200]
Don't check all of them

[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.200]
We have a camp kitchen

[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.200]
I'm free

[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.200]
Oh my god

[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.200]

It's so nice

[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.200]
It's so pretty

[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.200]
Wow it's the weather is so nice

[00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.200]

[00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.200]
Wind surfing?

[00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.200]
I think it's paradise

[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.200]
It's a heaven-made place

[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.200]
I don't want to be 10

[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:04.200]
You're gonna be 10

[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:05.200]

[00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:39.200]
Snapper

[00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:40.200]
So this is fresh off the boat

[00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:41.200]
So they basically give them a meal

[00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:42.200]
Me, gear, non-sterelies

[00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:44.200]

[00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:00.200]
Okay, guys

[00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:03.200]
This is for my Korean followers out here

[00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:07.200]
We are going to learn about beers in Australia

[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:09.200]
I love to say American for a second

[00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:10.200]
So this is the Pacific Pellow

[00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:11.200]
Stone in wood

[00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:12.200]
It is honestly a delicious beer

[00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:13.200]
It's just coming here and dry

[00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:14.200]
It's too much, right?

[00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:15.200]
Yeah

[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:17.200]
We ordered fresh off the boat

[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:18.200]
Yes, we did

[00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:19.200]
The YouTube are gone

[00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:20.200]
The healthiest option

[00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:23.200]
We got chips and she got some brown rice

[00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:24.200]
So it kinda made us look

[00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:25.200]
But funny

[00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:27.200]
I don't like chips that much

[00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:28.200]
Yeah, this isn't like chips

[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:29.200]

[00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:32.200]
I love a good chips

[00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:35.200]

[00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:43.200]
No

[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:44.200]
No

[00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:45.200]
No

[00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:48.200]
The thing about your people

[00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:49.200]
My people?

[00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:50.200]
Yeah

[00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:52.200]
What do they want to know?

[00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:57.200]
They want to know about the Australian working holiday life

[00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:01.200]
But I think maybe they are not that interested in my traveling video

[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:03.200]
And my daily work video

[00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:05.200]
They don't really care about your traveling

[00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:07.200]
I don't think so

[00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:08.200]
I don't know, I think

[00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:09.200]
Only we make a lot of money

[00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:11.200]
Wait, wait guys, wait, if you need a video

[00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:12.200]
If you need a video

[00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:16.200]

[00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:19.200]

[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:45.200]
Real snap-pong

[00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:46.200]
Brown rice

[00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:52.200]
It's so delicious

[00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:54.200]
I think it's a good thing to eat

[00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.200]
But it's real

[00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:57.200]
It's really good

[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:01.200]
It's real, but it's not good

[00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:04.200]
It's good to have a good time

[00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:05.200]
Good choice

[00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:06.200]
It's so American

[00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:07.200]
So American

[00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:08.200]
So Asian

[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:11.200]
In the same place

[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:13.200]
It's good, yeah, that's really good

[00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:19.200]
Oh, I got it

[00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:21.200]
It won't eat that far

[00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:30.200]
When you come, might I use an explosion?

[00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:31.200]
What do you know?

[00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:32.200]
I stopped talking

[00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:33.200]
Exactly

[00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:35.200]
Please know

[00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:44.200]
It's American

[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:45.200]
No

[00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:46.200]
No

[00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:51.200]
Wow

[00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:53.200]
It's not a taro

[00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:54.200]
What is it?

[00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:55.200]
It's my day

[00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:58.200]
Should I say it's a bit cold right now?

[00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:02.200]
Okay, so you've taken

[00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:05.200]
Just keep it like that for now

[00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:07.200]
Really? I think

[00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:08.200]
That's it

[00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:10.200]
You don't need it super, super strong

[00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:13.200]
Is it right to do it this way?

[00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:14.200]
Right that, yeah

[00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:16.200]
No, to be honest, I don't even know

[00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:17.200]
Okay

[00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:18.200]
But that looks pretty right to be honest

[00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:19.200]
I'll try

[00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:20.200]
Okay, I'll try

[00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:28.200]
This is a good thing

[00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:31.200]
I don't think it's a taro

[00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:36.200]
I don't know, I don't know

[00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:37.200]
Palm sweet home

[00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:41.200]
Palm sweet home

[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:42.200]
It's my day

[00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:45.200]
I'm going to show you

[00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:46.200]
The thing is

[00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:47.200]
I'm going to show you

[00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:49.200]
The double-dead

[00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:50.200]
And here

[00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:51.200]
And

[00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:55.200]
And here is the back

[00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:58.200]
That's a perfect pair of pants

[00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:00.200]
If you go in

[00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:02.200]
If you go in

[00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:04.200]
It feels like this

[00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:05.200]
Like this

[00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:07.200]
You like my

[00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:09.200]
Mommy bird

[00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:18.200]
It's good

[00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:21.200]
It's my day

[00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:23.200]
Let's see

[00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:25.200]
This pants can be worn

[00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:26.200]
But I don't think so

[00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:28.200]
The air is wide

[00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:33.200]
If you put your arms like this

[00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:34.200]
This much

[00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:36.200]
This much air

[00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:40.200]
Foot

[00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:48.200]
The pants are pretty

[00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:50.200]
It's not too tight yet

[00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:55.200]
But it works really well

[00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:56.200]
It's not too tight yet

[00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:58.200]
It's so cute

[00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:02.200]
It's delicious

[00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:05.200]
I don't think there's a lot of camping equipment in the wall

[00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:07.200]
It's the first time today

[00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:08.200]
I'm going to have a strong dinner

[00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:10.200]
But the lake is always like this

[00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:12.200]
I think it's good to have a wall

[00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:19.200]
Are you madly?

[00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:21.200]
No, it's for the skewer

[00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:25.200]
I was not a fan of cats come in Korea

[00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:27.200]
But now I really like it

[00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:28.200]
I'm not

[00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:29.200]
You're very worried

[00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:34.200]
I'm not worried

[00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:36.200]
I'm not worried

[00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:37.200]
I'm not worried

[00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:38.200]
My friends are gone

[00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:40.200]
I've been living here

[00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:42.200]
I've been living here

[00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:44.200]
I'm now at 8.42 am

[00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:48.200]
I'm going to go to the gym

[00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:49.200]
I'm going to sleep

[00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:51.200]
I think I should go to the gym tomorrow

[00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:53.200]
I think I should go to the gym

[00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:55.200]
I'm going to do something fast for 30 minutes

[00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:57.200]
I'm going to go to the gym

[00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:58.200]
I'm going to go to the gym

[00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:00.200]
It was the first day of camping

[00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:03.200]
It was a really busy day

[00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:06.200]
I think I'll be traveling for a week

[00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:09.200]
I hope it was fun

[00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:12.200]
Anyway, I'll be going to the road trip

[00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:14.200]
10 days

[00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:17.200]
It's done

[00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:19.200]
It's done

[00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:26.200]
It's so cute

[00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:29.200]
It's amazing

[00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:31.200]
