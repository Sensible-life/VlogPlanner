솔로의 기간이에요. 여러분들. 여러분들도 있다 없다 하잖아요. 그래서 여러분들 제가 더 만수록 넘침부터 끝내고 이시아님 솔로 지옥에 보면 그 남자친구가 없을 때가 귀한 타이밍이다 이런 얘기를 하시더라고요. 그래서 귀한 타이밍을 마찬김에 여러분들이랑 또 재밌는 걸 해보면 어떨까? 조금 유낙해 같긴 한데 바로바로 올라프의 소개팅 해줘. 어때요? 주변에 이제 오빠, 남동생, 또 괜찮 사람 있다. 이러면 저에게 소개팅을 해주시는 거 어떠세요 여러분들? 나를 해주고 싶다 언니가 아까워서 안 돼. 언니가 아까워요. 진짜 올라프 드리랑 그냥 사귀가 봐요. 진짜. 아 그러면 이상형이나 구체적으로을 퍼주세요. 저는 여러분들 그 주학 인생을 살아오면서 결심을 했어요. 나는 성격만 보겠다. 거짓말이라는 게 되게 많이 올라오고 있는데 이게 얼굴 부질 없어요. 그리고 능력 있는 것도 이렇게 부질 없고 결국에는 진국인 사람이 제일 중요하다 이런 생각이 들어가지고 사랑 많고 긍정적이고 좀 절제력 있고 배려심 있고 자기 성찰 능력이고 책임감이 있는 사람. 근데 여러분 진짜 인격적으로 성숙한 사람이 거의 뭐 멸쩍 위기 동물 보다 더 착이가 어려운 느낌이 애기 나아실 건가요? 언니 제후든요. 제혼하실 건가요? 이런 질문도 되게 많았는데요. 저는 좋은 사람이 생기면 하는 거고 안 생기면 안 하는 거고 애기도 뭐 생기면 안 하는 거고 안 생기면 안 하는 거고 너무 당연한 답변이가요? 제가 이 부분이 진짜 많아서 생각에 많이 해봤는데 이제 가정을 끓이는 상 그리고 독신해서 이 두 가지 상 모두 너무 아름다운 거예요. 뭐 어떤 사람이 더 낫다고 할 수 없애만큼 둘 다 너무 너무 아름다운 삶이라서 뭔가 저를 제안하지 않고 흘러가는 대로 살아가 보려고 합니다. 너무 에스지도 않고 그렇다고 너무 제안하지도 않고 그렇게 주어진 삶에 만족하면서 살고 싶어요. 그리고 남자 올리실 건가요? 이런 질문도 있었는데 저 올려볼까 봐요, 여러분들. 제가 막 당장은 결혼과 생각에 없다보니까 올리는 것도 나쁘지 않을 것 같다. 그렇게 남자 올리는 거 공부하는 과정이나 올리는 과정도 남자 냉동 브이로그로 찍어 보도록 하겠습니다. 뭐 돌싱 그 연프 섭외 없나요? 뭐 나갈 수 있는 그런 질문도 있었는데요. 불러줘야 갖다가지고 불러줘야 나갈 수 있는 거잖아요. 아무도 안 불러준데 어떻게 나가요? 뭐 전세용 결혼식이에요 지금. 일단 섭외가 안 들어오기도 하고 들어와도 재밌을 것 같긴 한데 제가 또 엔비타인 애니잖아요. 그래서 그런 다양한 상상을 많이 해요. 막 이제 최악의 상상까지 내가 악마의 편집을 당하면 어떻게 알겠지? 모르겠어요. 일단 뭐 들어오면 생각해보는 걸로. 아직 이사만 하신 거죠. 오 맞아. 이사 질루도 진짜 많았어요. 그래서 맞습니다, 여러분들. 저 이사를 갔는데 제가 회사를 여의도 넘겼는데 너무 넘거워요. 그래가지고 조금이라도 이제 회사로 가까운대로 이사를 가보려고 합니다. 그래서 요즘 취미가 맨날 인테리어 사진 보기 인테리어 가구, 쇼핑하기 이런 거예요. 그리고 또 이거 진짜 많았어요. 키, 오묵에 외모 관리 쿨틱. 160위에 지금은 48kg 정도 같고 여러분들이 아 우리 절대 살 줄 했을 때가 한 42kg 정도였어요. 여러분들이 오늘 주소에 야무지게 좀 살이쳤고요. 다이어트랑 몸매괄이는 마켓 따로 하는 거는 없는데 저는 뭔가 내 자신을 아껴주고 싶어요. 여러분들 너무 사랑하고 아기는 딸이 있으면 그 딸한테 막 라면 주고 막 햄 주고 몸에 나쁜 거 먹이지 않잖아요. 주스 갈아주고 인스턴트를 그래서 조금 덜 먹고 안 먹고 몸에 좋은 음식들 위주로 먹으려고 노력을 많이 하거든요. 이제 그게 버릇이 되다 보니까 크게 살이 찢은 않는 거 같아요. 그래서 여러분들도 진짜 스스로를 엄청 소중한 딸이라고 생각하고 뭔가 조금 것만 먹으려고 노력을 해보면 좋을 것 같아요. 그러면 피부도 되게 좋아지고 뭔가 장도 공간해지는 느낌? 그리고 또 진짜 중요한 외모쿨티비 진짜 잘 잔인 거. 이쁘나지만 제일 중요해요. 저도 이게 진짜 힘들었어요. 누워가지고 핸드폰 하다 보면 금방 새벽 때 그래가지고 여러분 제가 이거 진짜 광고 아니고 핸드폰 가목을 샀어요. 저는 한 9시부터 이 핸드폰을 가목으로 보내버립니다. 가목으로 보내면 이게 죽었다 깨나도 다음날 아침까지 안 열려요. 일단 핸드폰을 안 하고 저녁에 독서하고 누워서 명상하고 이런 거에 잠이 설술이 일찍어요. 그래야 피부도 좋아지고 다음날 컨셉도 좋아지고 살도 빠져 안 먹는다고 살 빠진 게 아니에요. 잘자야 빠져요. 그리고 여러분 제 택, 제 택도 많이 분이 해주셔가지고 제 택가 이제 여러분들 두 번째가 많은 질문이었어요. 남자친구 그다음에 제 택 거 있어. 우리 원래 우리 친구들이 이제 이렇게 제 택에 관심이 많아지는 나이가 된 거예요. 저는 이제 집순이어서 부동산의 제일 관심을 받아서 부동산을 공부까지는 아니지만 제 관심 있게 들여다보고 있고 원래 이제 제 권축을 바라보고 이렇게 두체를 가지고 있었어요. 근데 이제 두체를 정리하고 이번엔 저렇게 개발 호재가 있는 쪽으로 가볍게 합니다. 그리고 제가 그 예전에 부동산 영상 올렸던 거 기억나시나요? 그게 진짜 다시 봐도 완전 명강이에요. 그래서 이제 집사로 올라프친구들이나 부동산 관심이 올라프친구들은 그거 꼭 다시 보는 거 추천 완전 빅토음 될 것 같아요. 미국 주식이랑 이탭은 은행 신탁상품... 이제 미국 주식이랑 이탭은 은행 신탁상품을 통해 신탁! 이제 미국 주식이랑 이탭은 은행 신탁상품을 통해서 하고 있고요. 신탁상품 이상했죠. 신탁상품... 제가 자꾸 신탁상품이라고 바라만 하면 신탁상품이 아니라 신탁상품 맞습니다. 신탁상품부터 할게요. 미국 주식이랑 이탭은 은행 신탁상품으로 운영을 하고 있고요. 그리고 코이는 이제 컨트롤 하고 있는데 이 컨트롤 저도 처음에 좀 생각소했어요. 근데 이게 감이나 운해 맡기는 게 아니라 이렇게 알고리즘 기반으로 자동으로 사업하는 방식이거든요. 뭔가 제 자신을 신뢰하게 보다는 차라리 이렇게 남에게 맡기는 그렇게 하고 있습니다. 그리고 제가 스타트업 투자도 하고 있는데 오프을 회사랑 그리고 AI 기반으로 세팅 서비스 하는 회사에도 투자린데 진짜 이게 수인율 1등! 그래서 요즘 스타트업 투자에 관심이 너무 많아져서 혹시 스타트업하고 있는 올라프 친구들 투자 관심이 올라프 친구들은 AI자로 보내주시면 제가 또 검토하고 또 답변 드려보도록 하겠습니다. 국내주식은 제가 유일하게 실패한 투자인데요. 6월 초에 minus 68%로 소소자를 했어요. 제가 6월 초에 손질하고 다시 쭉 오르더라고요. 그래서 나랑 안 만나 보다 주식을. 그래서 저는 목도는 좀 위험도가 낮은 쪽에 그리고 여유 또는 공격적으로 좀 공부한다는 마음으로 하고 있거든요. 그러면 또는 이러도 또 배우는 남으니까 여러분들도 이렇게 하시면 좋을 것 같아요. 그리고 무리한 제테크는 또 정신이랑 건강을 망치니까 평정심을 유지할 수 있는 선에서 좀 추기가 아닌 투자를 한다는 마음으로 하면 편안한 마음으로 제테크도 성공할 수 있을 것 같습니다. 우리 올라프 친구들의 성공적인 제테크 생활을 응원합니다. 이번에는 여러분들 분위기를 좀 바꿔서 그 진지한 질문. 힘든 일 이겨내는 방법. 진짜 제가 올라프 친구들이랑 겪은 힘든 일만 해도 막 의료 수송도 있었고 의원도 있었고 제가 여러분들 소송도 안 해본 종류가

있어요. 좀 좀 왔다 갔다 하는 것 같아요. 힘든 일에 게임으로 치면 인생이 엄청 업그레이드 될 수 있는 그런 이벤트 캐스트 같은 거예요. 캐스트를 잘 계속. 내가 이거 급폭하면 얼마나 내가 더 멋진 업그레이드 된 사람이 되어 있을까? 급폭하고 나면은 그릇이 더 커지는 게 느껴지고 배우는 게 너무 많으니까 고난이 오면 이제 조금 살려더라고요. 고난에 닥치만
