저희 YX 디자인 팀은 직무서적을 했고 그 내용을 정리해서 팀원들에게 공유하는 자리가 있습니다 오늘 제가 앵글 책은 사용자를 끌어드리는 YX 유아의 비밀입니다 이북으로 읽을 예정했고요 580페이지 정도 임투껍고 무거운 책이기 때문에 저의 허리를 위해서 이북으로 구매해서 읽고 있습니다 그럼 이거 내용 좀 읽고 오늘 하루 마무리 해보도록 하겠습니다 오늘 저의 모티디입니다 오늘도 날이 춥다고 해서 간단히 챙겨 있고 얼른 출근해보도록 하겠습니다 오늘도 일찍 출근해보았습니다 오랜만에 저희 파트 분들이 모두 모였는데요 사실 저희 파트 분들은 올리벽 앱에 대해서 다양한 영역을 담당하고 계시기 때문에 업무적으로 자주 겹치진 않지만 현재 작업하고 있는 내용 그리고 함께 논의해야 하는 내용을 지약이를 나누고 있습니다 다음 주 얼룰의 라이브관의 오픈이에요 저희 가지고 오픈 전에 최종 전과하고 있고요 든지 그거15만 원 commission 저 옆에 앉아있는 윤yeong님이 같이 최종 우這是 같은 팀에 입사를 굉장히 Anxious 함께 çıkar 보내고 안녕하세 어떤 역병이 있었나요? 소만에 그런 것들이 막 할 때 해도 되나? 이런 거. 아... 몇 분에 최근 할 거야? 이거야? 70% 하고. 저 신입대 약간 믿음을 하나 말씀드리면 포즈탄으로 레몬캠이 있잖아요. 그럼 하루에 한 개씩 꼭 주시면서 오늘은 어려운 일 쓰셨는지 궁금한 적 없으셨는지 그럼每일매일 여쭤부였어요. 하탄을 계속 주시면 좋을까요? 레몬캠이 보면 진입이 생각이 나요. 대박. 어떠세요? 저희 디에트라사업봉부 워크사비에서 많이 또 프로그램을 했는데 제가 점심을 먹고 한 사이에 인명의 마이토분이 이렇게 선물을 넣고 가셨어요. 설계 직접 저거 주신 송편지랑 콜릿이랑 멀티비타민까지 넌 달달하고 건강한 연말을 보낼 것 같습니다. 감사합니다 마이토분님. 지금 물리부영 앱을 사용해보다가 개선이 필요한 부분을 발견해서 이 내용을 EX 개선협위체에 등록해 보려고 합니다. 이렇게 M4 개선이 필요한 부분을 캡쳐해서 개선 제안을 드려보려고 합니다. 짠. 여기가 바로 EX 개선협위체에 압권을 등록을 하는 곳인데요. 저희도 올리병에 뺏실지 유저하기 때문에 지속적으로 사용해보고 발견한 개선점이나 오류들을 이곳에 등록을 하고 있는데요. 저희가 지속적으로 회의를 하면서 어떤 것이 우선순위가 높은지 선별을 하고 개선 적용을 하려고 합니다. 지금은 선물하기 편지지 작업을 해볼 건데요. 선물하기에서는 선물 받으신 분이 선물과 함께 확인할 수 있는 편지지를 제공하고 있어요. 지금까지는 감사, 축하, 응원, 이런 키워드들로 편지지 작업을 했었는데요. 이제는 연말이기도 하니까 크리스마스의 느낌을 가득 담아서 제작을 해보려고 합니다. 지금은 올리병 테프 블록을 개선 작업을 해보려고 합니다. 디지털 사업봄부에 대한 소개와 개발자분들의 경험이 담긴 블록과 포스팅 되는 공간입니다. 지금은 이 블록을 올라오는 포스팅의 매너 이미지를 작업해보려고 합니다. 이런 식으로 이미지를 구성해서 실제 화면에 어떻게 보일지 안 본 시뮬레이션을 해볼 건데요. 이런 이미지를 제 여기에 입혀보면 이런 식으로 개선된 것을 확인해 볼 수 있습니다. 저는 오늘 떼겐을 하고 회사 입사 두기들이랑 저녁을 먹으러 왔는데요. 오늘의 저녁 메뉴입니다. 그런데 강남님 이렇게 시험을 보인다고 따라였던 말이야. 아이소레이션? 이게 안 돼. 이게 진짜 안 돼. 시험을 보는데 너무 힘든 거야. 그 동작이 시험을 보이면서 생각보다 내가 안 시험하다. 별거 없지만 제가 화상 때 보여드릴게요. 먼저 오른쪽에는 향수들을 넣어두었는데 일단 이 첫 번째로 제가 드린 향수는 제가 직접 만든 향수입니다. 향수 공방에 가서 개인적으로 좋아하는 향수들을 조합해서 만든 하나밖에 없는 향수고요. 저의 출근 시간은 단축하기 위해서 섀도우들 여기다가 혈처도 왔는데 이 힙핸들이 보일정도 너무 애용하고 있는 섀도우들이에요. 아 그리고 요거는 요즘에 제가 제일 많이 쓰고 있는데 지금 거의 남지 않았죠. 이게 원래는 임선 부용으로 나온 바디오일인데 겨울이 되면서 요거를 진짜 등폭둔 더 발라주고 있어요. 근데 살결이 진짜 부드러워져서요. 오늘은 대학교 동기들이랑 주말 약속이 있는 날입니다. 얼른 나갈 체비를 마치고 나가보도록 하겠습니다. 저는 약속정도에 도착했습니다. 얼른 올라가보도록 하겠습니다. 흥미를 하는데 게임을 대단했 MAC를 진짜 너무 좋아요! 우와! 브리즈요! 너무 좋아요! 이거! 지금 숙화를 마치고 입사는 카페에 왔는데 오늘 모인 봉기들이 저와 같은 후 디자인과 장공을 하는 친구들이에요. 이 친구는 지금 각오 회사에서 각오 디자인을 하고 있습니다. 친구 같은 경우에는 전공을 그대로 살려서 전화 제품과 각종 제품들을 디자인을 하고 있고 제 옆에 앉아 있는 친구는 제 록퍼면서 빅빅디와 잉북을 앱과 리랑원 디자인을 담당해주고 있습니다. 저는 좀 목적이니 많이 타고 천성을 펼칠 수 있는지 뭔가 아니어서 더 걸어볼까요? 음... 나의 입에 들어가고 지금 뭐 만족하나 했어? 나는 만족하니 나는 대학생들도 돌아와서 저한테 와서 지금 대학생들도 돌아와서 아주 좋아해! 네, 지금까지 올리브영 유아의 앱스 디자인 팀의 업무와 저의 일상을 잠시나봐 공유해드려 봤는데요. 올리브영 선물하기 많이 사용해주시고 이벤트로 준비되어 있다고 하니까 많은 삼미업 부탁드립니다. 안녕!
