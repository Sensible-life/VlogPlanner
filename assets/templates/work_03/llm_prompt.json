안녕하세요. 제 자리 간단하게 소개해 드릴게요. 우선 제가 개발할 때 쓰는 맥북 프로랑 모니터 그리고 키보드 이렇게 있습니다. 그리고 저희 이거 남은 입 궁금하셨을 텐데 저희가 어머상 되게 모니터 화면을 볼 일이 많아서 가리게 요로 쓰고 있는 남은 입입니다. 이 남은 입 팬 말은 제가 이 팀에 처음 입사했을 때 팀한 분들이 환영의 앰위로 만들어주신 겁니다. 엄청 귀엽죠? 저는 지금 온라임은 분영 및 개발을 진행을 하고 있습니다. 개발이 가능한 꺼내돼서 이렇게 일감으로 등록입니다. 저는 된 것 중에 제가 담당자로 지정이 된 업무들이 이렇게 할당이 되게 되고요. 이번에 개발하고 있는 겨는 이 리뷰 태블들면 리뷰 검색 필터라는 부분이 있어요. 이 부분은 기능 개선을 하는 부분을 맡았고 제 핏시에서 휴실을 진행을
