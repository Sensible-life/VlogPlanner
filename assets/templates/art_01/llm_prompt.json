| 제가 오랜만에 일상 브이로그를 찍는 것 같은데요. | 브이로그를 찍고 있는 이유는 | 제가 이번에 또 책을 만들었어요. | 컬러링북이 나왔는데요. | 1년 전에는 제가 종이이녀 옷잎이 책을 출간을 했었는데 | 이제 또 1년 동안 열심히 그렸던 그림들이랑 | 새로 그린 그림들 모아가지고 | 컬러링북을 예쁘게 만들어봤습니다. | 이런 느낌! | 제가 ASMR 채널을 하고 있거든요. | 그래서 거기 업로드를 하면 또 좋을 것 같아서 | 감사하게 해서 | 채색을 생긴 필로 직접 해보는 걸 | 촬영을 해보겠습니다. | 180도로 잘 펴지고요. | 이거는 암보를 물어봐주시는 분들이\n\n### Segment 8 (07:00)\n- Brightness: Bright\n- Energy: Low\n- Speech: 정말 많은데, | 컬러입니다. | 노트북 빛이 되경플러크라서 | 여기에 선을 연결해서 | 이거 펴주면 여기서 빛이 남으면서 | 이렇게 바람이 나오거든요. | 지금은 제가 노트북을 안 쓰고 있어가지고 | 요즘은 이거를 아이패드 거치대로 쓰고 있습니다. | 오늘은 여기에다가 | 이 책을 | 색치를 해볼거에요. | 색칠은 프리즈마 생년 비를 사용해볼겁니다. | 원래 저는 디지털 드루인보다 | 손크림을 더 선호하는 편이었거든요. | 근데 이렇게 외주도 받아야 되고 하다 보니까 | 지금은 디지털 드루행이 익숙해졌는데 | 엄청 오랜만에 직접 손크림을 그리는 거거든요. | 걱정 반 설렘 반 그런 마음입니다. | 일단 식소기를 | 해 드릴게요. | 완전 표지입니다. | 이 책에 들어간 일러스트들 중에서 | 가장 과진하게 그렸던 그림이고요. | 그래서 이거는\n\n### Segment 9 (08:00)\n- Brightness: Very Bright\n- Energy: Low\n- Speech: 예쁘긴 한데 | 책 안에 도안이 없어요. | 그거 아쉽긴 하지만 | 특별하니까 표지인 거겠죠? | 잠깐 크롭힐 들어가 있고 | 이거 좀 해보려구요. | 크롤러그 | 제 구매하신 분들은 한번 읽어보셨으면 좋겠습니다. | 이 책에는 총 4가지 책도가 있거든요. | 첫번째가 손유의 세계. | 여기에는 이런 패션 일러스트들 같은 | 이후로 일러스트들이 들어가 있습니다. | 제거 그리밍 데이 스티커로 | 만들어졌던 그림들이 많아요. | 너무 귀엽죠. | 그리고 두번째 책도는 손유의 하루입니다. | 여기 책도 이미지들 다 제가 직접 디자인한 거거든요. | 제가 정말 좋아하는 디자인 정공한 친구가 | 도움을 많이 줘가지고 | 이렇게 귀엽게 꾸밀 수 있었습니다. | 크롤러그 | 챕터 2 같은 경우에는 | 이렇게 조금 더 손여들의 일상을\n\n### Segment 10 (09:00)\n- Brightness: Very Bright\n- Energy: Low\n- Speech: 담으로 알러스트들이 들어가 있습니다. | 대경에 디테일이 많이 들어가는 그림들이 있는데요. | 자, 이 책으로 | 챕터 2가 있고 | 챕터 3은 | 손여의 로망입니다. | 보시다시피 여기는 약간 | 이런 순정만 원처럼 | 손여들과 손여들이 | 같이 등장하는 블러스트들을 | 넣어버렸습니다. | 전체적으로 | 색감이 디지털 화면으로 | 볼 때보다 연하게 뽑혔거든요. | 일부러 이렇게 한 게 | 이걸 보면서 채색을 하셔야 될 텐데 | 보시는 분들이 | 얘가 너무 진하게 인세가 되면 | 이런 명함이랄지 데뷔가 되는 | 면들이 잘 안 보일 것 같아서 | 일부러 조금 더 밝게 제가 | 고정을 했거든요. | 처음에는 너무 연한가 싶었는데 | 오히려 보다 보니까 | 이게 눈이 훨씬 편하더라고요. | 채색하실 때도\n\n### Segment 11 (10:00)\n- Brightness: Very Bright\n- Energy: Low\n- Speech: 훨씬 이쪽이 편하실 거라고 | 생각이 듭니다. | 마지막으로 챕터 4문입니다. | 손에 입고 | 제 이럴수들이 이렇게 모아놓고 | 여기 약간 이렇게 라벨 스티커 붙인 것처럼 | 제가 한 번 보면 | 제가 했을 때 | 꾸며되한 주제로 | 뭔가를 계속 만들어내고 싶었거든요. | 예전에 그림잘해서 | 했던 그림을 다시 그려보기도 하고 | 조금 더 탄타지적인 요소가 | 많은 일러스들을 | 챕터 4에 | 넣어두었습니다. | 여기서부터는 옛날에 그림잘해서 | 그림들을 | 다시 한번 그려봤어요. | 조금 더 깔끔해지고 | 정돈 된 느낌입니다. | 너무 귀여워. | 요 그림도 제가 | 정말 좋아하는 그림이에요. | 아직까지도 저한테 | 너무 예쁘게 남아있는 기억이 오가지고 | 제가 정말 정말 좋아하는 그림입니다.\n\n### Segment 12 (11:00)\n- Brightness: Very Bright\n- Energy: Low\n- Speech: 이렇게 하면 마무리로 | 지금 끝이 납니다. | 이리와. | 오늘은 그냥 챕터 1에 | 맨 첫 번째 있는 페이지란 번 | 제셋을 해보려고 | 펴가지고\n\n### Segment 13 (12:00)\n- Brightness: Very Bright\n- Energy: Low\n- Speech: 그래서 | 이렇게 완성을 해봤습니다. | 제 생각보다는 시간이 좀 걸려서 | 한 3일 정도 걸려서 완성을 한 것 같아요. | 아무래도 원래 그림이 | 이미 디스터를 그린다 보니까 | 평소에 화면을 확대를 해가지고 | 이렇게 작은 작업들이 편했는데 | 오랜만에 종애다가 직접 그릴려니까 | 그런 부분들이 어렵긴 하더라고요. | 그래도 생년필을 날 그렇게 깎아가지고 | 열심히 해보았습니다. | 약간의 팁을 드리자면 | 제가 이 선화 페이지들을 색깔 선은 그대로 남겨놓고\n\n### Segment 14 (13:00)\n- Brightness: Bright\n- Energy: Low\n- Speech: 좀 더 밝게 만들었거든요. | 그래서 색을 칠하시고 | 여기 위에다가 약간 더 선 따주듯이 따라 그려주시면 | 이렇게 더 선명하고 예쁘게 완성을 할 수 있을 것 같아요. | 저는 이번에 전체에서 생년필로 해가지고 | 더 오래 걸린 것 같거든요. | 밑손 같은 경우에는 수채와 마카 같은 걸 | 미리 한 톤 깔아 놓고 시작을 하면 훨씬 편할 것 같아요. | 다음 페이지 칠할 때는 수채와 마카를 | 더 사용을 해보면 좋을 것 같아요. | 이렇게 개 짧은 브이로그랑 | 책 소외까지 한 번 영상에 다 먹었는데요. | 제가 저번에 원입이 책 작업할 때는 | 번호시리 좀 크게 왔었거든요. | 이번 책 작업하면서는 | 핸디션이랑 체력적으로만급 조절을 잘 하려고 | 노력을 했습니다. | 그래서 요즘은 뭐 빼일 이렇게 똑같이 지내고 있어요. | 평일에는 거의 집에서 작업하고 | 밤에는 운동하거나 원래 수업을 하고 있고 | 그리고 주말에는 적어도 한 번은 꼭\n\n### Segment 15 (14:00)\n- Brightness: Bright\n- Energy: Low\n- Speech: 저를 위한 시간을 가지고 하고 있습니다. | 아무튼 제가 책을 이렇게 열심히 만들었거든요. | 여러분, 많은 관심 부탁드리겠습니다. | 제 그림이지만 소장같이 있다고 생각하거든요. | 꼭 색질 안 하셔도 되니까 | 이렇게 일러스트보는 재미도 소리 소리요. | 다이어리 꾸미시는 분들은 | 닦고용으로도 꽤 훌륭하지 않을까 생각해 봅니다. | 스티커로 나온 그림들 도움도 꽤 많이 들어있거든요. | 그래서 그걸 좀 더 크게 볼 수 있으니까. | 이런 그림들 너무 예쁘죠? | 작업하면서 진짜 너무 너무 즐거웠고 | 물론 체력적으로는 | 대경 많이 들어간 그림들을 일주일에 한 두, 세 장 뽑은 줘도 있었고 | 꽤 힘들었지만 그리는 도움이 정말 마음이 너무너무 즐거웠습니다. | 그림이 너무 잘 그려졌거든요. | 이 컬러임북이 오랜 시간 동안 저를 | 핀들게 했던 이 슬럼프를 나아질 수 있도록 도와주는 것 같습니다. | 저는 이제 아마 영상이 올라갈 때는 | 6월쯤이 될 것 같은데\n\n### Segment 16 (15:00)\n- Brightness: Bright\n- Energy: Low\n- Speech: 6월달에는 | 지일러스트랑 핑트, 콜라보를 해가지고 | 바로 공구를 할 것 같아요. | 지금도 바른 건데 색깔 너무 예쁘죠? | 근데 이거는 제가 영상을 만들기에는 | 일정이나 너무 좋고 할 것 같아서 | 아마 인스타그램이랑 제거 ASMR 유튜브 채널에 업로드를 할 것 같고요. | 그리고 치료되는 제가 또 그날 페어의 정가를 합니다. | 설패의 정가를 하는데 | 또 볼 수 있으면 만났으면 좋겠어요. | 많이 놀러오기요. | 이공 8월에는 아마 시간이 되면 | 설패했던 거랑 신상 스티커도 이렇게 해서 | 또 20에서 온라인 마켓 한 번 열 것 같고 | 9월에는 좋아하는 작가님들이랑 | 또 재민 오프라인 행사를 할 수 있게 될 것 같거든요. | 진짜 재밌는 걸 준비 중이니까 | 많이 기대해 주세요. | 하하 | 제가 이렇게 브이로그를 찍고 싶어도 | 자주 안 찍고 안 올리는 이유가 | 정말 매일이 똑같아요. | 그리고 뭐 그림 그리는 과정 같은 거는\n\n### Segment 17 (16:00)\n- Brightness: Bright\n- Energy: Low\n- Speech: 요즘 잘 안 올리는 이유가 또 있는 게 | 요즘 AI가 조금 문제잖아요. | 저도 채취 PT로 도움을 받고 있는 부분들이 | 뭐 업무 매일 같은 거 주고받거나 | 고민거리 같은 거 있을 때 채취 PT로 | 도움을 게 받고 있기 때문에 | AI가 뭐 완전히 나쁜 거다 | 이렇게 생각은 하는 건 아니지만 | 뭔가 그림 그리는 과정 같은 걸 올리는 거는 | 아무래도 조금 무섭더라고요. | 그리고 제가 다워밀 때 무조건 노래를 듣거나 | 유튜브 영상 제가 좋아하는 걸 틀어놓으면서 작업을 하거든요. | 근데 또 헤드셋이랑 이어폰 끼는 건 안 좋아해서 | 이 스피컬 요 그의 트러넛하기 때문에 | 영상을 찍으면서 | 그림을 그리기가 조금 어렵더라고요. | 아무래도 그림 그리는 것 자체만으로도 | 시간이 너무 오래 걸리고 하다 보니까 | 조금 어렵다. | 그래도 인스타그램에는 그림 꾸준히 올리고 있으니까 | 이러고 봐주신 분들 정말 감사드리고 | 만날 수 있다면 | 저희 7월에 또 코엑스에서 만나도록 해요.\n\n### Segment 18 (17:00)\n- Brightness: Bright\n- Energy: Low\n- Speech: 영상 보고 왔다고 말씀해주시면 | 정말 반갑게 인사해 드리겠습니다. | 이거 책 가지고 와주시는 분들은 | 와 샌드 해드리고 제가 덤도 많이 챙겨드릴 테니까 | 시간 되시는 분들은 꼭 코엑스 사이팅을 눌러 오세요. | 오늘은 여기서 영상 마쳐보도록 하겠습니다. | 안녕.\n\n(Total 18 segments)\n\n## Full Transcript\n올 집이다ег이는 작합시에 공식도 자여룩 오야 오야 오야 오야 오야 오야 오야 오야 안녕 안녕 가지고 쓴 사이 말아요 과자에서 어 그래요 그럼 이거는 사이 말아요 사이 말아요 여기 해볼게요 으아 오야 오야 오야 빛도 편집 치킨tech 싸런 au에 tớiRe- personajeگ영 하는ивается는 아 괜찮지도 않았어요 진짜 고마워요 여ющ� 우리 es 흐락밥 방범!(두첫The nhiacula이!) 애 오늘은 pacnod Sap를 cited 수어Bống 봉은지 송 오늘의 정신! 안녕! 잘 먹겠습니다! 와우! 안녕! 고마워! 아음! 안녕! 고마워! 고마워! 고마워! 고마워! 고마워! 고마워! 고마워! 고마워! 고마워! 고마워! 고마워! 고마워! 고마워! 고마워! 고마워! 작업을 보내주신 대로 시작하겠습니다. 눈썹도 그대로고, 여기 위꼽풀도 그대로다 보니까 눈은 위표정인데, 눈은 위표정인데, 임만 놀라는 느낌이어서, 어떻게 가면?

제가 오랜만에 일상 브이로그를 찍는 것 같은데요. 브이로그를 찍고 있는 이유는 제가 이번에 또 책을 만들었어요. 컬러링북이 나왔는데요. 1년 전에는 제가 종이이녀 옷잎이 책을 출간을 했었는데 이제 또 1년 동안 열심히 그렸던 그림들이랑 새로 그린 그림들 모아가지고 컬러링북을 예쁘게 만들어봤습니다. 이런 느낌! 제가 ASMR 채널을 하고 있거든요. 그래서 거기 업로드를 하면 또 좋을 것 같아서 감사하게 해서 채색을 생긴 필로 직접 해보는 걸 촬영을 해보겠습니다. 180도로 잘 펴지고요. 이거는 암보를 물어봐주시는 분들이 정말 많은데, 컬러입니다. 노트북 빛이 되경플러크라서 여기에 선을 연결해서 이거 펴주면 여기서 빛이 남으면서 이렇게 바람이 나오거든요. 지금은 제가 노트북을 안 쓰고 있어가지고 요즘은 이거를 아이패드 거치대로 쓰고 있습니다. 오늘은 여기에다가 이 책을 색치를 해볼거에요. 색칠은 프리즈마 생년 비를 사용해볼겁니다. 원래 저는 디지털 드루인보다 손크림을 더 선호하는 편이었거든요. 근데 이렇게 외주도 받아야 되고 하다 보니까 지금은 디지털 드루행이 익숙해졌는데 엄청 오랜만에 직접 손크림을 그리는 거거든요. 걱정 반 설렘 반 그런 마음입니다. 일단 식소기를 해 드릴게요. 완전 표지입니다. 이 책에 들어간 일러스트들 중에서 가장 과진하게 그렸던 그림이고요. 그래서 이거는 예쁘긴 한데 책 안에 도안이 없어요. 그거 아쉽긴 하지만 특별하니까 표지인 거겠죠? 잠깐 크롭힐 들어가 있고 이거 좀 해보려구요. 크롤러그 제 구매하신 분들은 한번 읽어보셨으면 좋겠습니다. 이 책에는 총 4가지 책도가 있거든요. 첫번째가 손유의 세계. 여기에는 이런 패션 일러스트들 같은 이후로 일러스트들이 들어가 있습니다. 제거 그리밍 데이 스티커로 만들어졌던 그림들이 많아요. 너무 귀엽죠. 그리고 두번째 책도는 손유의 하루입니다. 여기 책도 이미지들 다 제가 직접 디자인한 거거든요. 제가 정말 좋아하는 디자인 정공한 친구가 도움을 많이 줘가지고 이렇게 귀엽게 꾸밀 수 있었습니다. 크롤러그 챕터 2 같은 경우에는 이렇게 조금 더 손여들의 일상을 담으로 알러스트들이 들어가 있습니다. 대경에 디테일이 많이 들어가는 그림들이 있는데요. 자, 이 책으로 챕터 2가 있고 챕터 3은 손여의 로망입니다. 보시다시피 여기는 약간 이런 순정만 원처럼 손여들과 손여들이 같이 등장하는 블러스트들을 넣어버렸습니다. 전체적으로 색감이 디지털 화면으로 볼 때보다 연하게 뽑혔거든요. 일부러 이렇게 한 게 이걸 보면서 채색을 하셔야 될 텐데 보시는 분들이 얘가 너무 진하게 인세가 되면 이런 명함이랄지 데뷔가 되는 면들이 잘 안 보일 것 같아서 일부러 조금 더 밝게 제가 고정을 했거든요. 처음에는 너무 연한가 싶었는데 오히려 보다 보니까 이게 눈이 훨씬 편하더라고요. 채색하실 때도 훨씬 이쪽이 편하실 거라고 생각이 듭니다. 마지막으로 챕터 4문입니다. 손에 입고 제 이럴수들이 이렇게 모아놓고 여기 약간 이렇게 라벨 스티커 붙인 것처럼 제가 한 번 보면 제가 했을 때 꾸며되한 주제로 뭔가를 계속 만들어내고 싶었거든요. 예전에 그림잘해서 했던 그림을 다시 그려보기도 하고 조금 더 탄타지적인 요소가 많은 일러스들을 챕터 4에 넣어두었습니다. 여기서부터는 옛날에 그림잘해서 그림들을 다시 한번 그려봤어요. 조금 더 깔끔해지고 정돈 된 느낌입니다. 너무 귀여워. 요 그림도 제가 정말 좋아하는 그림이에요. 아직까지도 저한테 너무 예쁘게 남아있는 기억이 오가지고 제가 정말 정말 좋아하는 그림입니다. 이렇게 하면 마무리로 지금 끝이 납니다. 이리와. 오늘은 그냥 챕터 1에 맨 첫 번째 있는 페이지란 번 제셋을 해보려고 펴가지고 그래서 이렇게 완성을 해봤습니다. 제 생각보다는 시간이 좀 걸려서 한 3일 정도 걸려서 완성을 한 것 같아요. 아무래도 원래 그림이 이미 디스터를 그린다 보니까 평소에 화면을 확대를 해가지고 이렇게 작은 작업들이 편했는데 오랜만에 종애다가 직접 그릴려니까 그런 부분들이 어렵긴 하더라고요. 그래도 생년필을 날 그렇게 깎아가지고 열심히 해보았습니다. 약간의 팁을 드리자면 제가 이 선화 페이지들을 색깔 선은 그대로 남겨놓고 좀 더 밝게 만들었거든요. 그래서 색을 칠하시고 여기 위에다가 약간 더 선 따주듯이 따라 그려주시면 이렇게 더 선명하고 예쁘게 완성을 할 수 있을 것 같아요. 저는 이번에 전체에서 생년필로 해가지고 더 오래 걸린 것 같거든요. 밑손 같은 경우에는 수채와 마카 같은 걸 미리 한 톤 깔아 놓고 시작을 하면 훨씬 편할 것 같아요. 다음 페이지 칠할 때는 수채와 마카를 더 사용을 해보면 좋을 것 같아요. 이렇게 개 짧은 브이로그랑 책 소외까지 한 번 영상에 다 먹었는데요. 제가 저번에 원입이 책 작업할 때는 번호시리 좀 크게 왔었거든요. 이번 책 작업하면서는 핸디션이랑 체력적으로만급 조절을 잘 하려고 노력을 했습니다. 그래서 요즘은 뭐 빼일 이렇게 똑같이 지내고 있어요. 평일에는 거의 집에서 작업하고 밤에는 운동하거나 원래 수업을 하고 있고 그리고 주말에는 적어도 한 번은 꼭 저를 위한 시간을 가지고 하고 있습니다. 아무튼 제가 책을 이렇게 열심히 만들었거든요. 여러분, 많은 관심 부탁드리겠습니다. 제 그림이지만 소장같이 있다고 생각하거든요. 꼭 색질 안 하셔도 되니까 이렇게 일러스트보는 재미도 소리 소리요. 다이어리 꾸미시는 분들은 닦고용으로도 꽤 훌륭하지 않을까 생각해 봅니다. 스티커로 나온 그림들 도움도 꽤 많이 들어있거든요. 그래서 그걸 좀 더 크게 볼 수 있으니까. 이런 그림들 너무 예쁘죠? 작업하면서 진짜 너무 너무 즐거웠고 물론 체력적으로는 대경 많이 들어간 그림들을 일주일에 한 두, 세 장 뽑은 줘도 있었고 꽤 힘들었지만 그리는 도움이 정말 마음이 너무너무 즐거웠습니다. 그림이 너무 잘 그려졌거든요. 이 컬러임북이 오랜 시간 동안 저를 핀들게 했던 이 슬럼프를 나아질 수 있도록 도와주는 것 같습니다. 저는 이제 아마 영상이 올라갈 때는 6월쯤이 될 것 같은데 6월달에는 지일러스트랑 핑트, 콜라보를 해가지고 바로 공구를 할 것 같아요. 지금도 바른 건데 색깔 너무 예쁘죠? 근데 이거는 제가 영상을 만들기에는 일정이나 너무 좋고 할 것 같아서 아마 인스타그램이랑 제거 ASMR 유튜브 채널에 업로드를 할 것 같고요. 그리고 치료되는 제가 또 그날 페어의 정가를 합니다. 설패의 정가를 하는데 또 볼 수 있으면 만났으면 좋겠어요. 많이 놀러오기요. 이공 8월에는 아마 시간이 되면 설패했던 거랑 신상 스티커도 이렇게 해서 또 20에서 온라인 마켓 한 번 열 것 같고 9월에는 좋아하는 작가님들이랑 또 재민 오프라인 행사를 할 수 있게 될 것 같거든요. 진짜 재밌는 걸 준비 중이니까 많이 기대해 주세요. 하하 제가 이렇게 브이로그를 찍고 싶어도 자주 안 찍고 안 올리는 이유가 정말 매일이 똑같아요. 그리고 뭐 그림 그리는 과정 같은 거는 요즘 잘 안 올리는 이유가 또 있는 게 요즘 AI가 조금 문제잖아요. 저도 채취 PT로 도움을 받고 있는 부분들이 뭐 업무 매일 같은 거 주고받거나 고민거리 같은 거 있을 때 채취 PT로 도움을 게 받고 있기 때문에 AI가 뭐 완전히 나쁜 거다 이렇게 생각은 하는 건 아니지만 뭔가 그림 그리는 과정 같은 걸 올리는 거는 아무래도 조금 무섭더라고요. 그리고 제가 다워밀 때 무조건 노래를 듣거나 유튜브 영상 제가 좋아하는 걸 틀어놓으면서 작업을 하거든요. 근데 또 헤드셋이랑 이어폰 끼는 건 안 좋아해서 이 스피컬 요 그의 트러넛하기 때문에 영상을 찍으면서 그림을 그리기가 조금 어렵더라고요. 아무래도 그림 그리는 것 자체만으로도 시간이 너무 오래 걸리고 하다 보니까 조금 어렵다. 그래도 인스타그램에는 그림 꾸준히 올리고 있으니까 이러고 봐주신 분들 정말 감사드리고 만날 수 있다면 저희 7월에 또 코엑스에서 만나도록 해요. 영상 보고 왔다고 말씀해주시면 정말 반갑게 인사해 드리겠습니다. 이거 책 가지고 와주시는 분들은 와 샌드 해드리고 제가 덤도 많이 챙겨드릴 테니까 시간 되시는 분들은 꼭 코엑스 사이팅을 눌러 오세요. 오늘은 여기서 영상 마쳐보도록 하겠습니다. 안녕.",
