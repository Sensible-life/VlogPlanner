밴 놀이를 좋아하는 민족일까요? 이게 음색 광역봇. 중국 여화에도 나오는 그런 것 같아요. 와, 너무 예쁘다. 디아이 와이. 국룡이 귀엽게 그려져있네. 이런 식으로 방울관처럼 되어 있구나? 이 아래쪽에는 전통 방식으로 선을 염색하는 공장을 재현해놨는데 모로코에 패즈에 가면 가족이랑 그런 걸 염색하는 염료 공방 같은 데가 있거든요? 약간 고기 생강가요. 실장하는 거 볼 수 있었으면 너무 좋았겠다. 옷 파반대도 있어요. 예쁘다. 세트도 괜찮다. 오, 깔끔한데? 769면 14만원? 너무 귀여운데? 와... 먹거리들도 있고, 숙풍샵도 있고, 햇본 옷 가게도 있고 이렇게 예쁘게 꾸며들 가게도 있고요. 사진 찍기 너무 좋은데? 오, 배도 탄다. 아, 예쁘다. 어, 그때? 지금 괜찮아? 이게 너무 맛있겠다. 예쁘다. 저녁을 먹는 데요. 잘하라. 와, 식당, 저녁 오픈 넘. 와, 신장이 뛰기 시작했어. 와, 너무 맛있다. 와, 너무 맛있다. 와, 너무 맛있다. 와, 너무 맛있다. 와, 너무 맛있다. 와, 너무 맛있다. 와, 너무 맛있다. 와, 너무 맛있다. 와, 맛있겠다. 비대님. 여기 안 내려요? 비가 막히는 맛. 가디는 보내기에는? 내가 또... 지금 몇학년이에요? 어른이 다 5학년이면? 어른? 그건 아니야. 어른 좀... 어른 좀... 미안. 젠민이라고 하면 기분 나빠요? 젠민이는 비하과로니? 방정사가 해. 방정사가 있잖아. 애들은 젠민이라고 골랐는데 약간 중위형 이런 거랑 비슷한 거랑... 아, 그래? 귀여운 사람들에게 부르는 말인데 젠민이라는 거. 다시 한 번 살고 있는. 미안해요, 이제 젠민이라고 안 할게요. 저희 영화로 들어야지. 젠민이라고 하네. 빨리 당성에 올라갈 거예요. 걸어가면 한 2시간 정도 걸린데요. 근데 케이블카가 포함되어 있는 투어입니다. 여기는 멀리당성 중에 3화 대당성이라고 불리는 구역이고요. 기인 멀리당성 기율 중에 좀 제일 험준한 산맥지용에 위치한 곳이래요. 그래서 명나라 때 지어진 모습 그대로 좀 막루랑 성광이랑 길이랑 이런 것들이 많이 부손되어 있는 지역이라 전 세계적으로 아름다운 멀리당성 구역으로 꽃비는 곳이에요. 너무 많이 사랑하고... 왜요? 저희만 볼 수는 없잖아요. 눈치앞에 들어준 말아. 어? 안돼. 물 상관이 됐어. 그렇죠. 안돼. 갑자기 왜 다 안 된다고 됐다고. 이거 조금 올라왔다고 시원해졌다. 여기부터 한 2, 30분 정도 걸어서 올라가야 되요. 한인을 진짜... 빨간 소환이 많이 걸려있는 산이세요. 아니 이런 걸 보다? 아니 안 믿어. 소환이 올렸다 먹었어. 별로. 진짜? 응. 뭐 하고 싶은 게 딱히 이미 다 하고 있어. 그래? 멋진 삶이기도 있네? 그런 것 같아. 저의 헛컷거리는 소리가 다 들어가겠죠? 뭉쳐지 마세요. 아! 너무 힘들다. 저 혹시 할라이씨인가? 여쭤배가 할 때? 네. 저희가 서로 만약에 여행에서 싸우면 집에 갈 때 기네식 제일 배부르지 않은 걸로 바꿔주기로 했거든요. 생략 채식은 얘가 좋아하니까 빼고. 지금 이슬람식 고민 중인데. 와 이쁘다. 어때? 예쁘지? 잘 왔지? 와. 이슬람식 안 먹어도 되겠다. 미쳤다. 와, 너무 바쁘다. 산이 첫척 산 중 이 레이어트를 봐요. 이산 길을 따라서 쭉쭉쭉 다 말리장송 이어도 있는 거예요. 너무 신기하다. 아름다워. 제가 옛날에 왔었던 말리장송 쪽은 사람도 진짜 박을 박을 많았고 양 옆으로 성벽도 여기가 되게 약툼하게 돼 있어서 먼 산이 다 부위거든요. 여기는 주변 성과기 좀 높은 그런 곳이었어요. 그래서 이렇게 풍경 경치를 볼 수 있는 곳은 아니었거든요. 근데 지금 산이 벽겹이 쌓여 있는 산토보이고 서견도 너무 예쁘게 지고 있고 이래가지고 좀 특별한 곳은 맞는 것 같아요. 와, 고혹스신 보인다. 그리고 딱 이 구역만 말리장송 중에 유일하게 야간에도 개방되는 곳이거든요. 야경을 보러 밤에 올라올 수도 있어요. 다음에 다시 와야겠다. 여기가 밤에 그런 수를 하거든요. 겨울이나 이럴 때는 바람이 심하게 불고 이러면 못난데요. 근데 지금은 여름이고 바람도 많이 불지 않는 날이어서 할 것 같기 때문에 한번 가보겠습니다. 여기 다리 건너면 광장일 것 같아. 와, 미쳤다. 여기 너무 예뻐. 와, 미쳤다. 여기 동일한 곳은. 반대쪽도 아닌데. 괜찮아. 완전 고즈넉해. 아, 저기 사람들 줄 서 있네. 그런데 줄 서 있는 거 너무 귀여워. 와, 미쳤다. 되게 멀리까지 날아가는구나. 너무 예쁘다. 생각한 것보다 더 예뻐서요. 이제 온천을 하러 가보겠습니다. 여기 온천이 또 되게 예쁘거든요. 또한지 하스프링센터. 니하우. 치스에. 네, 기,랑 슬리퍼을 주시고요. 안에. 수건, 이슨. 샤워장도 깨끗. 번식사우나도 있고요. 39도. 꽤 중국스럽게 예쁘게 생겼어요. 다들 샤워도 하고 들어오고 수량복이 있고 들어와서 깨끗하고 수질도 빨갛고 있습니다. 굿. 밖으로 나가면 시래탕이 있는데 여기는 남녀 공용이라고 합니다. 바깥 같은 이런 먹방. 오, 우와. 우리 광차야. 우와. 와, 예쁘다. 너무 예쁘다. 이제 저희는 대망의 유니버절리 스튜디오의 가기의 베이징 시내로 돌아갑니다. 이제 어제까지 같이 여행하시던 분들은 오늘 아침 일찍 한국으로 돌아가셨어요. 인사를 하고 싶었는데 인사를 못 들어서 같이 여행하시던 분들도 이 영상 보시게 된다면 항상 행복하고 건강하세요. 여튼 자, 이제 베이징으로 돌아갈 건데 이거 제가 출장단이고 햇세트와 만들고 하면서 얻게 된 꿀팁인데요. 패키지 투어 프로그램들 중에 모든 투어 상품이 다 그런 건 아닌데 비행기를 빼고 투어 상품만 살 수 있거나 돌아가는 비행기를 좀 바꾸거나 할 수 있는 투어 상품들이 있어요. 이게 모든 상품이 다 그런 건 아닙니다. 그래서 꼭 문의를 해보셔야 되고요. 이제 저 같은 경우는 아예 안 된다고 하면 베이징의 상품로 돌아가는 비행기를 현돌었다로 끈을 생각까지 하고 그냥 한번 여쭤봤어요. 베이징 유니버절 스티이 돼 너무 하고 싶어서 근데 너무 무늬 좋게 밝건수수로만 추가로 내면 비행기 티켓을 바꿔주질 수 있다고 하는 거예요. 유니버절 스티이도로 들러가 잘 되고 이렇게 돌아가는 밑원 티켓을 바꿨습니다. 어때? 나 마음에 드세요? 아, 예쁘다. 아, 예쁘다. 이렇게 베이징에서의 오빤 6일을 마치도록 하겠습니다. 두 주 한국 사람들 상의 진짜 많이 가잖아요. 베이징 어보니까 이번에 그게 예쁜 곳들 많고 베이징도 중독에 중요한 곳이잖아요. 푸도 이기도 하고 그래서 역사 유접지도 많고 재미난 곳들도 많고 여행하기에 재밌을 것 같아요. 한 4월 정도가 제일 좋다고 하니까 4월 정도에 한 번 웃는 것도 추천합니다. 여러분, 그러면 저는 다음에 다시 찾아오뎅. 안녕. 안녕.
