지금 가고 있거든요? | 지금 덕이야. | 지금 열심히 찾아와고 있습니다.\n\n### Segment 2 (01:00)\n- Brightness: Medium\n- Energy: Low\n- Speech: 어, 네, 네. | 아, 못 가겠어요. | 저기만 가면 되는데 | 저기, 저기. | 못 가겠어. | 지금 도착을 했는데 | 되게 신기한 공간이야. | 와. | 오, 뭐지? | 여기 맞나? | 되게 안의 큰 공간이네요. | 이 오피스가 맞나? | 어디로 가야 되지? | 여기인 것 같아요. | 진짜 예쁘다. | 진짜 예쁘다. | 저는 도착했습니다. | 지금 동기가 와 있고요. | 열리라고 했었나요? | 내가 동기지. | 동기지, 너 뭐야? | 너 지금 다 최소했다고 나 버리는 거야?\n\n### Segment 3 (02:00)\n- Brightness: Medium\n- Energy: Low\n- Speech: 지금 동기가 열심히 일을 하고 있어요. | 예쁘다, 여기. | 네. | 너 일 하고 있었어? 시작했었어? | 아니, 줄 알고 있었어. | 줄 알고 있었어? | 밥 먹었어? | 지금 밥을 먹으러 왔어. | 먹으러 왔어? | 지금 밥금

(03:00)\n- Brightness: Bright\n- Energy: Low\n- Speech: 한 소, Services. | 코터 소고프 상태. | 탱스해라 | 저 지금 일하다가 엄청난 곳에 발견해서 | 와 이거 진짜 여기 개인 홈트레인인하는 곳이래요 | 아 진짜 저 약간 드림플레이스 같아 | 저 여기 앉아서 얘기를 해봐야겠어요 | 여러분 여기 너무 예쁘지 않아요? | 아 근데 여기가 진짜 예쁜데\n\n### Segment 5 (04:00)\n- Brightness: Bright\n- Energy: Low\n- Speech: 영상 찍으니까 또 약간 그냥 꽉짝 꽉짝하게 나오긴 하네요 | 하여튼 오늘은 약간 초심을 찾은 느낌이 있어서 | 프리로서 어떻게 첫 걸음을 내리던는지 | 조금 여러분께 공유를 드리려고 합니다 | 프리레인 서품만 아니라 | 약간 직장 다니시면서 투잡 아니 요새 도전 많이 하시잖아요 | 그런 분들에게도 조금 도움이 되는 내용일 것 같으니까요 | 영상 끝까지 봐주세요 | 첫 번째로 입맥이에요 | 입맥하면 연줄 뭐 하견 지연 이런 것들이 떠오르는데 | 프리레인 서에게 입맥이랑 | 서로에게 좋은 동요이자 신어질 수 있는 멘토 같은 역할을 해요 | 저도 처음에 사실 프리로 활동하시는 분이 거의 없었고 | 처음에는 정말 수입이 영예 수렴했기 때문에 | 그대는 굉장히 자신감도 없고 | 좀 우울해져서 집에만 있었어요 | 그러다 보니까 점점 더 우울해지고 | 일이 더 안 풀리는 것 같더라고요 | 그래서 그냥 어차피 뭐 이렇게 집에 있는다고 해서 | 하늘에서 돈이 뚝 떨어지는 건 아니니까 | 나가서 뭐라도 해보자\n\n### Segment 6 (05:00)\n- Brightness: Bright\n- Energy: Low\n- Speech: 그래서 제가 관심 있는 분야에 | 클래스, 모솜호임, 컴퍼런스 이런 걸 | 다 참석을 했어요 | 그리고 간 다음에 새로 만나는 사람이잖아요 | 그럴 때 저를 굉장히 어필을 많이 하면서 | 나는 이런 이런 걸 관심 있고 | 이런 일을 하고 싶다를 적극적으로 어필을 했습니다 | 사실 제가 그렇게 사교적인 성격이 아닌데 | 그때는 그런 에너지가 어떻게 나는지 모르겠어요 | 뭐라도 집을 하기라도 잡고 싶어서 | 인맥이 없다면 제가 스스로 개척해서 | 좀 만들려고 노력을 했던 것 같아요 | 그러다가 거의 대부분이 그때 한번 만나고 | 다 흐집부지 되는데 | 한 세 번째, 네 번째 참석했던 컴퍼런스에서 | 제가 대학교 때 교양소업을 들었던 강사님을 만나게 돼요 | 근데 다행히도 그때 그 강사님이 | 저를 기억하고 계시더라고요 | 그래서 아직까지도 뭐 그런 일 한니 | 이런 거 아직도 하고 있니 하면서 | 막 그나마 주고받다가 | 그때 그 강사님이 | 오고도 근데 이런 거 한번 해볼 수 있니 | 뭐 나는 이렇게 준비하고 있는데 | 이거 해줄 사람이 필요한데\n\n### Segment 7 (06:00)\n- Brightness: Bright\n- Energy: Low\n- Speech: 너가 한번 해볼래?라고 해서 | 그때 그 길로 처음으로 외주일을 맡게 됩니다 | 좀 아주 감엾스러운 순간이죠 | 그런 식으로 이제 하나씩 풀려나가기 시작했고 | 이렇게 당장 뭐가 성사가 되지 않더라도 | 내가 이런 일을 하고 싶다고 알려놓으면 | 그럼 언젠가 또 이런 거 주의해 할 사람 없나 | 하다가 내 생각이 나면 또 연락을 거 아니에요 | 그러니까 막 가족이나 친구 이렇게 사적으로 하는 사람이 아니라 | 비즈니스 관계로 맞는 사람들한테 | 좀 내가 어떤 일을 하고 있고 | 어떤 거를 할 수 있다는 것을 어필을 해두면 | 좀 좋을 것 같습니다 | 아 제가 근데 인미컬연에서는 | 정말 말할 내용이 많은데 | 오늘은 여기까지 하고 | 제가 또 다른 영상으로 한번 준비를 해보도록 하겠습니다 | 그 다음 두 번째 | 빠밤 | 두 번째는 이제 크몽으로 익히 알고 있는 | 재능 마켓 사이트에요 | 이런 건 어떤 플랫폼이냐면 | 자기가 할 수 있는 것과 포트폴리오를 올려두면 | 그 기술이 필요한 사람들이 들어와서 | 이제 구매를 하는 사이트에요\n\n### Segment 8 (07:00)\n- Brightness: Bright\n- Energy: Low\n- Speech: 근데 이거 요새 되게 말이 많죠 | 진짜 누가 누가 더 싸게 해줘나 | 이 경쟁이 되버려서 | 저희 시장과 그 말도 안 되게 떨어지는 현장이 일어났는데 | 그럼에도 불구하고 | 제가 두 번째로 이 재능 마켓을 여러분께 | 추천 드린 이유는 | 처음으로 일감을 받고 싶은 분들에게는 | 정말 일거보다 좋은 사이트가 없는 것 같아요 | 근데 이게 회사반 다니거나 | 뭔가 프리로 한 번도 일을 해보지 않은 분들은 | 처음에 그 약간 누군가의 돈을 받아서 | 내가 일을 한다는 게 좀 무서울 수가 있어요 | 저도 좀 그랬거든요 | 그래서 분명히 난 이걸 할 능력이 되는데도 불구하고 | 뭔가 내가 전문가는 아닌 것 같고 | 되게 심리적인 허드리 크단 말이에요 | 근데 여기는 뭐 좋은 건지 나쁜 건지 모르겠는데 | 가격이 정말 말도 안 되게 낮게 책정되다 보니까 | 솔직히 다 이 가격은 받아야 된다 | 이런 생각이 들어서 | 되게 심리적인 부담 없이 외주를 받을 수가 있어요 | 근데 이게 진짜 약간 자두적으로 말하는 게 아니라 | 정말 처음 시작하시는 분들한테는\n\n### Segment 9 (08:00)\n- Brightness: Bright\n- Energy: Low\n- Speech: 이게 좀 크게 자격을 하거든요 | 그래서 어느 정도까지 내가 자신감이 부기까지는 | 약간 이렇게 좀 가격이 낮게 책정된 외주들을 하거든요 | 그 정도의 외주들을 하면서 스킬업도 시키면서 | 그런 심리적인 허드를 넘을 수 있는 것에 | 굉장히 좋은 역할을 하는 것 같아요 | 그리고 두 번째로 | 이제 개인적으로 외주를 받다 보면 | 좀 비슷한 작업들만 쌓이거든요 | 분명히 다 다른 건데 다 똑같아 보여 | 근데 이런 재능 마켓을 이용하다 보면 | 내가 생각지도 못한 분야의 일들이 막 들어와요 | 그러다 보니까 내가 좀 처음에 포트폴리오를 만들어야 할 때 | 이런 사이트들을 이용하면 | 내 포트폴리오가 정말 다채로워진다는 거 | 그리고 마지막으로 | 이게 좀 포인트인 것 같은데요 | 그 시장을 확실히 알 수가 있어요 | 단적인 일로 한번 영상 작업을 외주를 받는다고 쳐요 | 저는 막 흐뭇이나 다른 사이트를 이용하기 전까지는 | 영상 하면 유튜브 밖에 몰랐어요 | 근데 이런 재능 마켓이라는 플랫폼을 띄워들면서\n\n### Segment 10 (09:00)\n- Brightness: Bright\n- Energy: Low\n- Speech: 내가 그 시장을 경험하고 나니까 | 내가 몰랐던 분 분들이 너무 많이 보이는 거예요 | 이런 분야에서 영상 수요가 있구나 | 이런 분야로 커리어를 개발할 수 있겠다라는 | 커리어 패스가 그려져서 직접적으로 시장을 좀 체감할 수 있는 플랫폼이 될 것 같아요 | 근데 제가 제일 처음에 외신들이었던 것처럼 | 정말 가격이 말도 안 되는 가격으로 책정이 되어 있고 | 거기에다가 또 플러스로 플랫폼이 때 간 20% 수료가 있잖아요 | 그래서 결국 나한테 떨어지는 돈은 완전 용돈 | 그래서 어느 정도 포트폴리오에 쌓고 | 자신감 쌓고 깔끔하게 | 그리고 마지막으로 개인 SNS 채널이에요 | 사실 이거는 프리랜서 뿐만 아니라 | 저는 모든 분들께 좀 추천을 드리고 싶어요 | 예전보단이 자기 브랜딩 하는 것도 굉장히 복편화됐고 | 개인 SNS를 통해서 나도 몰랐던 세계가 열리는 경험이 돼요 | 그리고 제가 받았던 큰 일 꺼낼 받는 거는 | 흐뭇도 아니고 입맥도 아니고 개인 SNS 채널이었던 것 같아요\n\n### Segment 11 (10:00)\n- Brightness: Bright\n- Energy: Low\n- Speech: 그리고 그분들은 그냥 내 기술을 원하는 게 아니라 | 뭐 내 브랜드나 아니면 내 작업들이 원하는 거라서 | 페이 뿐만 아니라 굉장히 대우도 좀 좋게 해주셨던 것 같아요 | 즐거운 마음으로 서로 존중하면서 일할 수 있어서 | 개인 SNS 채널은 정말 적극적으로 추천을 드립니다 | 이렇게 말하면서 나도 똑바로 안 하고 있어요 | 더 열심히 해보겠습니다 | 제가 이렇게 간단하게 한 세 가지 정도로 정리해서 여러분께 말씀을 드렸는데요 | 여러분이 좀 궁금하신 내용이 있다면 또 댓글로 달아주시면 | 그 부분에 좀 더 집중해서 또 영상을 준비해볼게요 | 더 빨리 열심히 해서 | 저도 이런 작업실을 빨리 구해보려고요 | 야 근데 더 나갔다 왔다 | 뭐 하는 거야? | 이거 3분 남았다고? | 나도 찍어줘\n\n### Segment 12 (11:00)\n- Brightness: Medium\n- Energy: Low\n- Speech: 이거 음소가 할 거지? | 나 잘 찍어 잘 찍었어 | 꼬만 잘 찍었어 | 그만해 알겠어 | 알겠어 | 찍을까 봐\n\n(Total 12 segments)\n\n## Full Transcript\n다음 아 아, 나 진짜 너무 좋아. 아, 나 진짜 좋아. 아, 나 진짜 좋아. 아, 나 진짜 좋아. 아, 나 진짜 좋아. 아, 나 진짜 좋아. 아, 나 진짜 좋아. 아, 나 진짜 좋아. 아, 나 진짜 좋아. 아니, 제가 맨날 집에서 이러니까 좀 효율이 안 나는 것

제가 스스로 개척해서 좀 만들려고 노력을 했던 것 같아요 그러다가 거의 대부분이 그때 한번 만나고 다 흐집부지 되는데 한 세 번째, 네 번째 참석했던 컴퍼런스에서 제가 대학교 때 교양소업을 들었던 강사님을 만나게 돼요 근데 다행히도 그때 그 강사님이 저를 기억하고 계시더라고요 그래서 아직까지도 뭐 그런 일 한니 이런 거 아직도 하고 있니 하면서 막 그나마 주고받다가 그때 그 강사님이 오고도 근데 이런 거 한번 해볼 수 있니 뭐 나는 이렇게 준비하고 있는데 이거 해줄 사람이 필요한데 너가 한번 해볼래?라고 해서 그때 그 길로 처음으로 외주일을 맡게 됩니다 좀 아주 감엾스러운 순간이죠 그런 식으로 이제 하나씩 풀려나가기 시작했고 이렇게 당장 뭐가 성사가 되지 않더라도 내가 이런 일을 하고 싶다고 알려놓으면 그럼 언젠가 또 이런 거 주의해 할 사람 없나 하다가 내 생각이 나면 또 연락을 거 아니에요 그러니까 막 가족이나 친구 이렇게 사적으로 하는 사람이 아니라 비즈니스 관계로 맞는 사람들한테 좀 내가 어떤 일을 하고 있고 어떤 거를 할 수 있다는 것을 어필을 해두면 좀 좋을 것 같습니다 아 제가 근데 인미컬연에서는 정말 말할 내용이 많은데 오늘은 여기까지 하고 제가 또 다른 영상으로 한번 준비를 해보도록 하겠습니다 그 다음 두 번째 빠밤 두 번째는 이제 크몽으로 익히 알고 있는 재능 마켓 사이트에요 이런 건 어떤 플랫폼이냐면 자기가 할 수 있는 것과 포트폴리오를 올려두면 그 기술이 필요한 사람들이 들어와서 이제 구매를 하는 사이트에요 근데 이거 요새 되게 말이 많죠 진짜 누가 누가 더 싸게 해줘나 이 경쟁이 되버려서 저희 시장과 그 말도 안 되게 떨어지는 현장이 일어났는데 그럼에도 불구하고 제가 두 번째로 이 재능 마켓을 여러분께 추천 드린 이유는 처음으로 일감을 받고 싶은 분들에게는 정말 일거보다 좋은 사이트가 없는 것 같아요 근데 이게 회사반 다니거나 뭔가 프리로 한 번도 일을 해보지 않은 분들은 처음에 그 약간 누군가의 돈을 받아서 내가 일을 한다는 게 좀 무서울 수가 있어요 저도 좀 그랬거든요 그래서 분명히 난 이걸 할 능력이 되는데도 불구하고 뭔가 내가 전문가는 아닌 것 같고 되게 심리적인 허드리 크단 말이에요 근데 여기는 뭐 좋은 건지 나쁜 건지 모르겠는데 가격이 정말 말도 안 되게 낮게 책정되다 보니까 솔직히 다 이 가격은 받아야 된다 이런 생각이 들어서 되게 심리적인 부담 없이 외주를 받을 수가 있어요 근데 이게 진짜 약간 자두적으로 말하는 게 아니라 정말 처음 시작하시는 분들한테는 이게 좀 크게 자격을 하거든요 그래서 어느 정도까지 내가 자신감이 부기까지는 약간 이렇게 좀 가격이 낮게 책정된 외주들을 하거든요 그 정도의 외주들을 하면서 스킬업도 시키면서 그런 심리적인 허드를 넘을 수 있는 것에 굉장히 좋은 역할을 하는 것 같아요 그리고 두 번째로 이제 개인적으로 외주를 받다 보면 좀 비슷한 작업들만 쌓이거든요 분명히 다 다른 건데 다 똑같아 보여 근데 이런 재능 마켓을 이용하다 보면 내가 생각지도 못한 분야의 일들이 막 들어와요 그러다 보니까 내가 좀 처음에 포트폴리오를 만들어야 할 때 이런 사이트들을 이용하면 내 포트폴리오가 정말 다채로워진다는 거 그리고 마지막으로 이게 좀 포인트인 것 같은데요 그 시장을 확실히 알 수가 있어요 단적인 일로 한번 영상 작업을 외주를 받는다고 쳐요 저는 막 흐뭇이나 다른 사이트를 이용하기 전까지는 영상 하면 유튜브 밖에 몰랐어요 근데 이런 재능 마켓이라는 플랫폼을 띄워들면서 내가 그 시장을 경험하고 나니까 내가 몰랐던 분 분들이 너무 많이 보이는 거예요 이런 분야에서 영상 수요가 있구나 이런 분야로 커리어를 개발할 수 있겠다라는 커리어 패스가 그려져서 직접적으로 시장을 좀 체감할 수 있는 플랫폼이 될 것 같아요 근데 제가 제일 처음에 외신들이었던 것처럼 정말 가격이 말도 안 되는 가격으로 책정이 되어 있고 거기에다가 또 플러스로 플랫폼이 때 간 20% 수료가 있잖아요 그래서 결국 나한테 떨어지는 돈은 완전 용돈 그래서 어느 정도 포트폴리오에 쌓고 자신감 쌓고 깔끔하게 그리고 마지막으로 개인 SNS 채널이에요 사실 이거는 프리랜서 뿐만 아니라 저는 모든 분들께 좀 추천을 드리고 싶어요 예전보단이 자기 브랜딩 하는 것도 굉장히 복편화됐고 개인 SNS를 통해서 나도 몰랐던 세계가 열리는 경험이 돼요 그리고 제가 받았던 큰 일 꺼낼 받는 거는 흐뭇도 아니고 입맥도 아니고 개인 SNS 채널이었던 것 같아요 그리고 그분들은 그냥 내 기술을 원하는 게 아니라 뭐 내 브랜드나 아니면 내 작업들이 원하는 거라서 페이 뿐만 아니라 굉장히 대우도 좀 좋게 해주셨던 것 같아요 즐거운 마음으로 서로 존중하면서 일할 수 있어서 개인 SNS 채널은 정말 적극적으로 추천을 드립니다 이렇게 말하면서 나도 똑바로 안 하고 있어요 더 열심히 해보겠습니다 제가 이렇게 간단하게 한 세 가지 정도로 정리해서 여러분께 말씀을 드렸는데요 여러분이 좀 궁금하신 내용이 있다면 또 댓글로 달아주시면 그 부분에 좀 더 집중해서 또 영상을 준비해볼게요 더 빨리 열심히 해서 저도 이런 작업실을 빨리 구해보려고요 야 근데 더 나갔다 왔다 뭐 하는 거야? 이거 3분 남았다고? 나도 찍어줘 이거 음소가 할 거지? 나 잘 찍어 잘 찍었어 꼬만 잘 찍었어 그만해 알겠어 알겠어 찍을까 봐",
