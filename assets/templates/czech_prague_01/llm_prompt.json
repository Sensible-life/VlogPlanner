느낌은 없고 | 자연스럽게 톤아리는 것 같아서 | 그래서 너무 좋아요 | 하영씨 메이크업을 다르게 하는 편인데 | 이렇게 바끌 때는 또 | 예전에 많이 하던 데일리베이크 | 그대로 하게 되는 것 같아요 | 그리고 저 요즘에 | 완전 잘 쓰고 있는 블러셔가 있어서 | 이거는 꼭 보여드려야지\n\n### Segment 23 (22:00)\n-

물보다 맥주가 상경을 잘 지고 있는데 이게 역사 중대부터 시작된 거 같아요 그래서 초개는 간의 수공업으로 이걸 만들었는데 뭔가 발휘해야 되는 지식이 없어 집에서 맥주를 만들니까 뭔가 풍질이 길이라지 않았을 때 그래서 이제 그래서 소도원 양도에서 만들기 시작했죠 맥주를 입고 대량으로 만들면서 풍질이 좋아하는 거 이제 그래서 이제 소도원 양도에 입에 적다고 맥주를 판론이 또 소도원에 못힘이 됐는데 그래서 이제 계속 이렇게 입을 것 같아요 그래서 물이 길었던 시절에 소도사들이 매일 살이터에 매일 맥주를 마시고 금지 기간 동안은 또 영양색질이 맥주에 잊어야 돼 너무 신기한 역사 사실 소로를 마시면 진짜로 수야에서 수야에서 그리고 저희는 여기 양조장 앞에 있는 소도원이 도서관이 가려고 뒤쪽에서 끝났어요 여기는 소도원이 도서관이예요 완전 화려하죠 여기 있는 고존되문에 들어가지 못하는데 위에 프레스코 누가 수집을 했나 봐요 그리고 K-본드특징 이런마 저의 집안 위주를 입고 가고 너무 아이가 나무 도저히 나무 정규야 있는데 이 안에는 그 나무에 대한 연락을 자세한 것들을 이런 설명을 이렇게 다 다르겠어요 딱 줬던 그치 너무 정규야 그리고 옷을 보면 제가 같은데 진저

집으면 입기 좀 하자 저희는 밥 먹고 나오니까 완전 해질역이어가지고 이제 프라성으로 다시 야경을 보러 갑니다 여러분 트램을 타고 있어요 완전 지금 해가 다 치고 개냑시에요 지나가면서 보는데 아까 봤던 성비트 수성당히 엄청 예뻐요 아니 생각보다 근데 이 야경스빨은 너무 느끼운 것 같아요 너무 해가 다 지고왔더니 약간 야경이 할 거 없음이지 그래서 아까 안왔더니 그냥 프라성 개딴 내려갑니다 이게 약간 지옥에 개덴이라고 불리는데 저희는 한 번도 안 걸어봤거든요 그래서 가라세를 합니다 개동에도 벌써 프라에서 세 번째 날이에요 오늘은 밖에 보니까 엄청 날씨가 안 좋더라고요 저는 아침은 7시쯤 이뤄었는데 엄마 아빠는 더 일찍 일어났거든요 근데 아침에 진짜 폭풍가 왔다고 하더라고요 딱 제가 일어날 때쯤에 말기 개가지고 지금은 약간 흐릿 말금? 그 사인 것 같아요 그래서 나갈 준비하는 걸 같이 찍어 보려고 카메라를 켜봤는데 기초랑 상크림은 다 한 상태고 베이스 버터 바를 겁니다 이거 발라줄 건데 사실 코스너리는 제가 너무 너무 잘 쓰고 있고 이거 쓴지는 정말 오래된 것 같은데 그 기동인들도 저 이 토너 크림 너무 잘 쓰고 있는 거 아실 거예요, 그렇죠 이거는 진짜 이렇게 하얀 토너 크림인데 그냥 로션처럼 엄청 편하게 발리거든요 이렇게 진짜 완전 크림이 이렇게 부드러운 이런 제형인데 이게 그냥 톡톡톡 두드려서 발라주면 완전 흡수가 바로 착되는 그런 느낌이어서 피부가 약간 내 피부 원래 하얀 데 10% 정도로 자연스럽게 손업이 되거든요 저는 펌핑 하나로 오해가를 하거든요 그래서 그냥 크림 바라듯이 발라주고 흡수시켜주면 되는데 처음에는 롤링 해주고 그냥 이렇게 두드려주면 금방 흡수가 되거든요 어떤 베이스를 하던 베이스 밑에 깔아주면 그 톤업이 확실히 달라, 정말 그냥 내 피부가 원래 하얀 데 화사해진다고 해야 되나 쓸모에 이렇게 발라줘도 피부도 좋아 보이고 은근 촉촉하면서 너무 유분기 있게 마무리되거나 이런 게 없이 딱 깔끔하게 마무리해야 되거든요 그래서 너무 좋은 거 그래서 저는 이거를 바른다고 파운데이션 옷을 높이지 않는데 이거를 바르고 나서 파운데이션에 발라주면 원래 쓰던 옷을 쓰다라도 약간 좀 더 화사한 느낌이 있어가지고 고개 되게 좋더라고요 피부, 립부터 완전 다르지 않나요? 그리고 저는 이거를 가끔씩 짧은 하얀 입을 때 무릎에 발라주는데 무릎에 발라도 묻어남도 없고 끈적할지도 안 와서 진짜 바리에 바르기도 너무 좋다 그런 거 생각할 거군요 그래서 이건 진짜 용량도 또 크고 하다 보니까 팔꿈치나 무릎, 팔꿀, 목, 새골 이런 데까지 다 발라주도 돼가지고 이건 진짜 제 화장대의 화장대의 제형이어트구 쓰는 제품이라고 말이죠? 그걸 지금처럼 이렇게 히노니버도 요 크림 자체가 흰색이다 보니까 무덤하는 걱정도 없고 그렇다고 또 까모데디 보면 무덤 아니야 그것도 아니거든요 그냥 착 달라붙어서 마무리가 돼가지고 무덤은 이런 것도 없습니다 이게 이 4시간 톤업 지속력 임상 테스트까지 완료했다고 하거든요 실제로 저도 요거 바르고 나갔을 때 나가 이 전부 다 이 화사함이 사라진다거나 이런 거를 하나도 못 느낀 없어요 그래서 정말 외치라는 시간에 이 화사함은 지속되는 거 같고 약간의 생활품성에 있어서 땀이랑 습기 이런 모에도 방수가 되거든요? 이렇게 또 좋은 제품이다 보니까 저만 좋다고 느낌이 아니잖아요 이게 누적 판매량이 200만 긴가? 아무튼 진짜 많더라고요 진짜 후퀴도 너무 좋고 이 정도로 팔린 거면 정말 다들 꾸준히 잘 쓰는 템이지 않을까 싶어요 그리고 요건의 성분도 자연율의 성분이어가지고 한국 정식으로 이제 비건 인젠 받은 제품이기도 합니다 그래서 요건은 이번엔 올리벼여서 8월에 올령비으로 산업된 제품이거든요? 그래서 요거 기획세트로 제가 완전 잘 쓰고 있는 피니쉬 파우더 요거까지 같이 집려오게 되거든요? 그래서 파우더 좀 고민이신 기둥이들은 요거 기획스도 같이 구매해서 같이 써봐도 진짜 좋을 것 같아요 요거 꽃스마이 톤아크림은 올리브양 온라인 오프라인에서 다 할인 내 가격으로 구매할 수 있다고 하니까 요거 잘 쓰고 있는 기둥이들도 그리고 톤아크림 새로 고민하시는 기둥이들도 한번 사용해서 잘 써봤으면 좋겠습니다 이거 진짜 추천하거든요 저는 이제 바로 베이스 베이컵부터 해줄게요 근데 사실상 요거 발르고 나간다고 해서 톤아크를 엄청 올려서 기초를 하는 게 아니라 그냥 원래 쓰던 저는 21호 쓰고 있거든요? 그래서 사실상 너무 하얀 거 아니야? 이런 느낌은 없고 자연스럽게 톤아리는 것 같아서 그래서 너무 좋아요 하영씨 메이크업을 다르게 하는 편인데 이렇게 바끌 때는 또 예전에 많이 하던 데일리베이크 그대로 하게 되는 것 같아요 그리고 저 요즘에 완전 잘 쓰고 있는 블러셔가 있어서 이거는 꼭 보여드려야지 생각했어요 343번인데 안 보이네 진짜? 예쁜데 이따가 제가 여기 야외 나가가지고 자연관에서 한번 보야될게요 진짜 보았는데요 조식은 여기 댄실너소터의 롯프타업에서 먹거든요? 근데 또 고기가 엄청 예쁘고 실제로는 유료로 카페를 운영하는 옷이라고 해가지고 어제 엄마가 되게 좋았다고 해서 저도 가볼까 합니다 아, 진짜? 완전 예쁘다 조식이 꽤나 동료가 많은데요? 이렇게 간단하게 챙겨 먹습니다 나쁘지 않은 것 같아요 저는 오늘도 나갈 준비를 끝내고 왔습니다 화별 먹고 준비해서 그런지 엄청 든든해요 이 호텔의 단점은 전신거울이 제대로 없어서 뭔가 착사술 찍을 때 이렇게 어둡게 찍어야 된 단점스 아무튼 오늘은 이렇게 웨이브 머리도 하고 이제 나갑니다 저희는 화벨시장에 도착했습니다 화벨시장은 이렇게 조그마나 상점같은 가들이 바닥바닥 붙어 있는 시장이에요 여기는 이런 약간 목공이 같은 것들이 되게 많아요 시계가 유명하다 보니까 목공 시계도 이렇게 많고 여기 화벨시장에는 이렇게 베리들이 모든으로 판매라고 했어요 또 화벨시장에서 이런 거 사먹는 게 유미라고 하더라고요? 차이도 되게 예쁘게 있다 쨘 쨘은 요거 하나를 샀습니다 요거 한 마만 정도 하는 거여서 엄청 상관하는데 또 여기서 이거 먹는 게 유미라고 하니까 라즈베리 마치 여기 딱 와서라나? 너무 신뢰? 너무 예쁜 호라구시같이 색깔이 알록달록 진짜 예쁘다 저희는 여기 정말 시계탑 열어왔어요 나 시계 너무 쉬워서 예쁜데? 시계탑에 약간 전설이 있는데 이게 엄청 시계적인 이 프라의 시계를 만들어 놓은데요 근데 프라 시장이 이 장인이 더 이상 이것만큼 멋진 시계를 다른 곳이 못 만들게 하려고 이 시계장인의 눈을 멀게 했다는 거예요 이 시계가 완성되게 나서 그랬다가 장인이 죽기 전에 내가 만든 시계 한번 만지게 달라고 했는데 이 시계가 돌아가지 않게 만져던다는 그런 전설이 있습니다 물론 지금은 돌아가고 엄청 유명해서 이렇게 당강스대에 엄청 많아요 이거는 600년도 내면 만들어 놓을게요 1400맨년도에 만들어져 있는데 완전 디테일이 대박이에요 600년도에 만들었다고 생각할 수 없는 디테일이에요 건강을 쌀이고 있어야 하는데 그 시계는 프라는 광장도 진짜 예쁘죠 여기는 여기 그냥 쭉 구경을 해보려고요 거리만 구경해도 구경하게 만들 것 같아요 여기는 성니콜라스 교회고 여기는 아마 안 들어가고 그냥 화약탑을 갈까 합니다 우리 권장 권장 너무 예쁘죠 여기 지나가다가 골특방을 먹어보려고요 여기에서 산 구경을 해보려고요 여기에서 산 구경을 해보려고요 저희가 사고 나니까 사람들이 엄청 많아졌는데 저는 이번에는 다크

보이고 사실 저는 여기서 바라본 프라우피를 더 좋아하거든요 요거는 성니콜라스 교회도 있고 그리고 보면 프라우성도 있고 그리고 보면은 깔류 이렇게도 보이거든요 그래서 프라우 둔체가 다 보이는데 완전 시원하고 예쁜 뷰를 볼 수 있는 곳입니다 부모님도 여기가 더 예쁜 것 같아요 계속 지난던 이면서 이런 천문텔리어 보이는 뷰를 본인 거예요 예쁘죠 진짜 모든 곳곳이
